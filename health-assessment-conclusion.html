(2pts each correct answer.)School from Horne Should Be ImplementedHomeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home.

(2pts each correct answer.)School from Horne Should Be ImplementedHomeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented f the threat of COVID-19. because of thFirst reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to say at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case ofcovid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadfulabout the health of their children.The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes Instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time plarning and preparing a good learning modality for the saks of the students as Briones said that "Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.​</h2><br />
