                        <p>Domestic Violence is one of the most serious public health and criminal justice issues women face today. One in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. The risks associated with domestic violence affect not only the victim, but her family and friends, responding police, and concerned bystanders as well. Domestic violence can happen in all forms of emotional, psychological and mental abuse. Unfortunately, many victims don’t always get the chance to seek help, sadly some wait to long, believing it’s them or things will get better. This article is to inform women, that they are not alone and speaking up helps not only them but helps open societies eyes and bring awareness to this underserved population. Domestic violence occurs when one person in an intimate relationship or marriage tries to dominate and control the other person. Should you ever find yourself faced with this, know there are plenty of resources available to help assist you through this transitional process. Residents of Dutchess County should know of these very important advocates available to assist with the emotionally straining violence, and those who also offer shelters.</p><br />

                        Violence against women (VAW), also known as gender-based violence[1] and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV),[2] are violent acts primarily or exclusively committed against women or girls. Such violence is often considered a form of hate crime,[3] committed against women or girls specifically because they are female, and can take many forms.<br />VAW has a very long history, though the incidents and intensity of such violence have varied over time and even today vary between societies. Such violence is often seen as a mechanism for the subjugation of women, whether in society in general or in an interpersonal relationship. Such violence may arise from a sense of entitlement, superiority, misogyny or similar attitudes in the perpetrator or his violent nature, especially against women.<br /><br />The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."[4]<br /><br /><br />

                        <p>The promotion
of the culture of non-violence always starts within the family. For all we
know, violence is cyclical, which means it gets “paid forward.” Moreover, the
desensitization toward violence of the youth may contribute to their thinking
that violent incidents are natural occurrence, which is not the case. Violence
is voluntarily done by individuals.</p><br />

Domestic and gender-based violence is an issue that affects too many people throughout our country. The statistics are staggering. According to a 2017 report, more than 40 percent of women in the United States have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner.</p><p></p><p>It is our responsibility to recognize the prevalence and seriousness of violence against women and to take action to prevent it. We must recognize the dynamics of certain societal norms that perpetuate this violence and work to address inequalities that give rise to it. We must educate ourselves, our families, and our communities about the issue and promote greater intolerance for it.</p><p></p><p>We must also provide survivors with the resources and support they need to navigate their legal, financial, and practical challenges—whether it is resources from a domestic violence center or crisis hotline, or access to legal aid services to help with the expungement application process.</p><p></p><p>In addition, we must ensure that our elected officials are aware of this issue and its causes and effects, and that they understand the need for policies that reduce the prevalence of gender-based violence and help victims rebuild their lives.</p><p></p><p>Violence against women is not a problem we can ignore. We must take action. Let's all commit to making our communities safer and fairer places for women to live, work, and thrive. Thank you.</p>SPEECH <p></p><p>As an oratory on violence against women, consider that the cases of <strong>women physically</strong> and <strong>psychologically assaulted</strong> in recent years have unfortunately become commonplace, in the same way as the murder of women.</p><p></p><p>There are countless cases of ex-boyfriends and ex-husbands <strong>who threaten</strong>, <strong>beat</strong> and <strong>even kill</strong> their ex-partners after the end of the relationship, which only intensifies violence against women,</p><p></p><p>Recently the femicide law was passed, representing a victory for women, but much more needs to be done so that these <strong>cases of aggression against women are</strong> <strong>extinguished</strong>.  </p><p></p><p><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>What advantages did women have with the creation of the responsible parenting project?  </p>https://brainly.ph/question/30304889<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A culture where violence is prohibited will create a safe, peaceful, and assuring healthy environment. The effects of violence are far beyond our comprehension--it may transcend from generations to generations. A place where people are understood and feelings are considered is a healthy and motivating environment. People who are free from physical abuse are more productive. Those who are emotionally and mentally unstable are given fair opportunity to be themselves without the fear of being misunderstood. A society which possessions and wealth are shared with others is the dream of everyone wishes to create. When everybody is considerate about the welfare of others, the community grows in maturity that our lives are not only our own but also to others whom we live with. Humility and acceptance of differences may help us realize what we dream about. Though it may seem to be hard to achieve, but it is not impossible. All we have to do is to believe and trust others as they believe and trust us.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> These practices are often seen as rites of passage for new members, but they come at a great cost. Hazing and fraternity violence are dangerous, unnecessary, and unacceptable practices that must be eradicated from our campuses.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, hazing and fraternity violence are dangerous. Every year, there are reports of students being injured, hospitalized, and even killed as a result of hazing activities. These practices often involve physical abuse, excessive drinking, and other dangerous behaviors that put students' health and safety at risk. In addition, hazing and fraternity violence can have lasting effects on the mental health and well-being of those who have been subjected to these practices. It is simply unacceptable to put students in harm's way in the name of tradition or camaraderie.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, hazing and fraternity violence are unnecessary. There are many other ways for students to build friendships, develop leadership skills, and engage in community service without resorting to these harmful practices. In fact, many fraternities and sororities have shifted their focus in recent years to promoting positive values and making a positive impact on their communities. By embracing these more positive values, fraternities and sororities can help to create a culture of respect and inclusivity on our campuses.</p><p></p><p>Finally, hazing and fraternity violence are unacceptable. These practices go against the fundamental values of higher education, which are centered on learning, growth, and the pursuit of knowledge. They create a culture of fear, intimidation, and exclusion that has no place in our institutions of higher learning. We must hold ourselves to a higher standard and reject these harmful practices once and for all.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, hazing and fraternity violence are dangerous, unnecessary, and unacceptable practices that have no place on our college and university campuses. It is time for us to take a stand against these harmful practices and work to create a culture of respect and inclusivity that celebrates diversity and promotes positive values. Only then can we truly create a safe and supportive environment for all students to learn and grow.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Hazing and fraternity violence are two issues that continue to plague college campuses across the country. While some may see hazing as a harmless tradition or a rite of passage for new members of a fraternity, the reality is that it can have serious and even deadly consequences. Similarly, fraternity violence, which often involves excessive drinking and physical assaults, can cause harm not only to the members of the fraternity, but also to innocent bystanders and the wider community. There is no denying that hazing and fraternity violence are deeply problematic and harmful practices that should not be tolerated. The physical and emotional abuse that can result from hazing can cause lasting damage to individuals and their families. Moreover, the excessive drinking and risky behaviors associated with fraternity violence can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. Furthermore, hazing and fraternity violence are antithetical to the values of higher education and the principles of community building and respect for others. These practices promote a culture of exclusion, elitism, and entitlement that can be corrosive to the social fabric of college campuses. Rather than fostering a sense of community and belonging, they create divisions and hierarchies that can be damaging to the mental health and well-being of students. In conclusion, hazing and fraternity violence are not only harmful but also go against the core values of higher education. It is essential that colleges and universities take a stand against these practices and work to create a culture of safety, respect, and inclusivity on their campuses. Education, awareness, and strict enforcement of anti-hazing and anti-violence policies can help to prevent these issues from occurring and ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\\\[-Tricia[/tex]</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We have come to a point where everyone feels unsafe and unsecure because of the countless acts of violence that are happening in our society. There had been so many people in the past who died, who became victims, who were injured, and who suffered because of other people’s violent behaviors. When we open the television, we see people killing, murdering and abusing other individuals or group of people. We see all the news headlines in newspapers screaming about the unending conflicts between nations and unimaginable crimes that are happening in every part of the world.As of today, violence is doubtlessly widespread and this has been one of the issues that our society is still struggling to find for solutions.</p><p>We might recognize the fact that almost all of us have good morals and values, and have good intentions but we can not deny that people are also capable of the most offensive and menacing behavior. But we always ask ourselves, do we get something good out of acting violently? Many of us object on the spread of violence because for the obvious reason that imposing pain into a person, making him suffer or lose his life is an immoral act.We might also need to acknowledge the fact that people have their own reasons and intentions for acting violently, but is it worth it? Is violence necessary to solve every conflict? Is violence really necessary that most of the people have been engaging themselves with these all sort of obnoxious behaviors? Violence is not necessary especially in situations where violence is not used for a good cause and there are also other ways to compromise a dispute, but there are also extreme situations where violence is necessary especially when we are protecting our lives or other people’s lives from evil people.There are different cases of violence that are happening in our society today and one of the most serious cases of violence is domestic violence.</p><p></p><br />
