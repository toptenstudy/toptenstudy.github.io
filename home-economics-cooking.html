1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                                            In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1.

of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                            27. In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1. What benefits did the bees provide to Mr. Shumba and the environment?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. Make a list of some developments in this local community as a result of the beekeeping.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3.

How did burning the bees affect Mr Sumba‘s family, the community, the illegal harvester and the natural environment? ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5.

How can we use this to build a sustainable community?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________hum​</h2><br />
