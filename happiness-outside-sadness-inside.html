The Man and his Camel
Once there was a man who had a greedy camel. One cold night, the ma went to sleep in his tent. He heard a noise. He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent.
"Master!" said the camel. It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there."
The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside."
A little later, the camel said, "Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long.
"Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the comer so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all
"Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn," said the greedy camel. There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside."
The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold

The Man and his Camel
Once there was a man who had a greedy camel. One cold night, the ma went to sleep in his tent. He heard a noise. He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent.
"Master!" said the camel. It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there."
The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside."
A little later, the camel said, "Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long.
"Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the comer so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all
"Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn," said the greedy camel. There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside."
The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold
