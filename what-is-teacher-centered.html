                                            The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. Traditional materials like printed books, chalk board, and flashcards are used in the classrooms before. On the other hand, technology like e- books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning. No matter how similar and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place in both. 1. What are being compared in the text? A. Schools of today and Schools in the past B. Teachers of today and Teachers in the past C. Traditional teaching materials and modern technology 2, What are their similarities? A.

                                            Chickering and Zelda (1991) identified five principles of online learning. The first principle is to establish regular effective contact which requires a specific time for instruction and progress monitoring. The second principle is to create opportunities for student-centered learning – a task that took most of the time of the teachers' planning. There are instances when teachers become the center of interaction in the online environment, given the number of MELCs that they need to cover. The third principle is to create practical, real world applications that provide authentic tasks for students despite the remote learning scenario. The fourth principle is to provide support for student-learning and autonomy.Teachers should provide aid for learners to maximize skills development. The last principle is to ensure all course content is readily and easily accessible to all students – an area that teachers tried to compensate by uploading materials on a weekly or semi-weekly basis. 1.

On the other hand, technology like e- books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning.

                                            Suspension bridges are known to be normal around the world, especially in developed countries. These bridges usually have towers of some sort and cables, both of which have great importance in the integral stability of the bridge. A STEM student makes some plans for his project on a suspension bridge model. He first tries to draw his model. The towers are 12 meters high and 20 meters apart ( 10 meters away each from the origin in the center), and the cable he drew between and from the top of the two towers are of course, parabolic. The lower point of the cable is 3 meters above the origin. He shows this model to his teacher, and the teacher asks him, "What is the vertical distance from the road to the cable at 5 meters away from the center?" What is the answer to the teacher's question?​</a>

                            4. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. Traditional materials like printed books, chalk board, and flashcards are used in the classrooms before. On the other hand, technology like e- books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning. No matter how similar and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place in both. 1. What are being compared in the text? A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a facilitator, the teacher takes on the role of guiding, coaching, and supporting students in their learning journey. Instead of being the sole source of knowledge, the teacher encourages and facilitates active and collaborative learning among students. The teacher creates a learning environment that fosters exploration, inquiry, and critical thinking. The teacher also serves as a conductor, orchestrating and coordinating learning activities and resources to ensure that students achieve their learning goals. Like a midwife, the teacher nurtures and supports the growth and development of students, helping them to overcome obstacles and challenges. Finally, like a gardener, the teacher cultivates and tends to the learning environment, providing the necessary resources and support for students to thrive and flourish. Overall, the teacher as a facilitator empowers students to take ownership of their learning, and encourages them to become lifelong learners.</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Chickering and Zelda (1991) identified five principles of online learning. The first principle is to establish regular effective contact which requires a specific time for instruction and progress monitoring. The second principle is to create opportunities for student-centered learning – a task that took most of the time of the teachers' planning. There are instances when teachers become the center of interaction in the online environment, given the number of MELCs that they need to cover. The third principle is to create practical, real world applications that provide authentic tasks for students despite the remote learning scenario. The fourth principle is to provide support for student-learning and autonomy.Teachers should provide aid for learners to maximize skills development. The last principle is to ensure all course content is readily and easily accessible to all students – an area that teachers tried to compensate by uploading materials on a weekly or semi-weekly basis. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since each wall of the classroom forms a straight angle, the sum of the first angle and the third angle is 180 degrees.</p><p></p><p>Let x be the measure of the third angle.</p><p></p><p>We know that the line dividing the straight angle in front of the teacher's table forms two angles with measures of 78 degrees and x degrees. Thus, the second angle formed by the line dividing the straight angle is:</p><p></p><p>180 - 78 - x = 102 - x</p><p></p><p>Since the line dividing the straight angle forms two adjacent angles, the sum of the second angle and the third angle must also be 180 degrees:</p><p></p><p>(102 - x) + x = 180</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the equation, we get:</p><p></p><p>102 = x + 180 - x</p><p>102 = 180</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the measure of the third angle is:</p><p></p><p>x = 78 degrees</p><p></p><p>Hence, the measure of the third angle is 78 degrees.</p><br />

Traditional materials like printed books, chalk board, and flashcards are used in the classrooms before. On the other hand, technology like e- books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning. No matter how similar and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place in both. 1. What are being compared in the text? A.

                            28. Suspension bridges are known to be normal around the world, especially in developed countries. These bridges usually have towers of some sort and cables, both of which have great importance in the integral stability of the bridge. A STEM student makes some plans for his project on a suspension bridge model. He first tries to draw his model. The towers are 12 meters high and 20 meters apart ( 10 meters away each from the origin in the center), and the cable he drew between and from the top of the two towers are of course, parabolic. The lower point of the cable is 3 meters above the origin. He shows this model to his teacher, and the teacher asks him, "What is the vertical distance from the road to the cable at 5 meters away from the center?" What is the answer to the teacher's question?​</h2><br />
