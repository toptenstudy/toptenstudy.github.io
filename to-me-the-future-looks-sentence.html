Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.

That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

Read Vice President Leni Robredo graduation message to Class of 2020 and identify its geographic and linguistic dimension Dearest Class of 2020 Congrats to you and to your proud parents for making this f I know this is not how you imagined your graduation to be-no applause, no IG worthy photos no partes, no big speeches. Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair. We need to book beyond ourselves and expand our circles of empathy-whom we wil help, whom we will, whom wer will ve for We need to ask the hand, important questions How can I make the world a better place for others?

That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days.

NOTE: All answers must be in CAPITAL  Directions: Read the following excerpts (from essays) carefully.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
