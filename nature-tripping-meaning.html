                    <p>Last year ,the Girl Scouts in our school celebrated their anniversary with a field trip. They explored the virgin forests of Palawan. They went around a place where a thick long line of trees where not yet touched by loggers.
 The local officials told them that these forests help their community have a steady supply of water and electricity.
 The girls appreciated how the people in the community work together in keeping their forests unspoiled. They learned the value of preserving nature and taking good care of our forests.

Which excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment" best reveals the allegorical nature of this short story?
 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</a>

With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</p><p>This excerpt reveals the allegorical nature of the story because it shows that the character of the widow is symbolic of the idea of aging and the loss of beauty. She wishes that the coffin-lid were over her face, since it could be no longer beautiful, which is a metaphor for death and the end of life. This passage is showing how the characters in the story are symbols for deeper concepts and ideas.</p><br />
