Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

This was no reflection on Filipino men- of the American occupation. First, it was humanly impos- sible for the Filipino nation to recover quickly from the paralyzing effects of the repression in thought and speech which has been their lot under Spanish rule. The Filipinos could not, therefore, take immediate advantage of their newly acquired right to be heard. Second, the Filipinos first had to learn a medium alien to them in its psychology, construction, sound, and spelling. Third, even if after they had learned the English language sufficiently for ordinary communication, they discovered that literary standards for English differed radically from those in the vernacular literatures (or in Spanish which formed part of the herit- age of the more fortunate).​</a>

Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes. Even the PhilippineNational Police looked at it from a different perspective, unemployment could mean more crimes.Depressing times indeed.

Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />

The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />

                            18. Mapalo: The struggle is real: Depressing yet hopefulJuly 3, 2020 Sunstar Daily BaguioIt's been almost four months now since the government announced a national quarantineThese are supposed to be Baguio's peak season for tourists. Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes. Even the PhilippineNational Police looked at it from a different perspective, unemployment could mean more crimes.Depressing times indeed.
