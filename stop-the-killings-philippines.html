                                            An international terrorist is holding the remote control to a bomb placed in a sold-out Justin Bieber concert in the Philippine Arena. Police intelligence made a confirmation that the terrorist is currently attending a birthday party in your best friend’s house. The only way to stop the bombing is to kill the terrorist by bombing the house to make sure that the remote control and the terrorist are destroyed instantly. This in the only way to save all the people in the concert. If you were the president of the Philippines, would you bomb the house to kill the terrorist and save the people in the concert, or would you let the terrorist live and save your friend and everyone in the house, but sacrifice the lives of all the people in the concert?​</a>

                                            No. XVIII. A terrorist group called the
Emerald Brigade is based in the State
Asyaland. The government of Asyaland does
not support the terrorist group, but being a
poor country, is powerless to stop it.
The Emerald Brigade launched an attack
on the Philippines firing two missiles that
killed thousands of Filipinos. It then
warned that more attacks were
forthcoming. Through diplomatic channels
the Philippines demanded that Asyaland
stop the Emerald Brigade; otherwise, it will
do whatever is necessary to defend itself.
Receiving reliable intelligence reports of
another imminent attack by the Emarld
Brigae, and it appearing that Asyaland was
incapable of preventing the assault, the
Philippines sent a crack commando team to
Asyaland. The team stayed only for a few
hours in Asyaland, succeeded in killing the
leaders and most of the members of the
Emerald Brigade, then immediately
returned to the Philippines.
(a) Was the Philippine action justified under
the international law principle of self-
defense? explain your answer (3%)
(b) As a consequence of the foregoing
incident, Asyaland charges the Philippines
with violation of Article 2.4 of the United
Nations Charter that prohibits "the threat
or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any
State. The Philippines counters that its
commando team neither took any territory
nor interfered in the political processes of
Asyaland. Which contention is correct?
Reasons (3%)
(c) Assume that the commando team
captured a member of the Emerald Brigade
and brought him back to th Philippines.
The Philippine Government insists that a
special international tribunal should try the
terrorist. On the other hand, the terrorist
argues that terrorism is not an
international crime and, therefore, the
municipal laws of the Philippines, which
recognize access of the accused to
constitutional rights, should apply. Decide
with reasons. (3%)</a>

Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of death, cancer and other diseases in the Philippines. Smokers are not only ones risking illness and deaths from cigarettes: second-hand smoke also kills and weakens. Many experts trace incidents of asthma and other respiratory ailments among children to second-hand smoker. Cigarettes are deadly: the risks are real; the benefits are non-existent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarette altogether. 2.

                                            Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

experience high fever, dry cough,
shortness in breathing that may cause
death if not properly attended to. It is

time transmitted to humans. What is scary about this virus, lately, it
resulted millions of people and even killed a big number throughout the
world.
There is no available medicine for this disease and medical experts are
still finding ways to find a cure for this COVID 19. The Philippines is one of
the 180 countries affected. Mostly the most progressive nations with modern
hospital facilities have the greatest number of deaths and confirmed positive
patients. With this the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19
as a pandemic which means the disease was prevalent over the whole world.
Corona Virus Disease or COVID 19 has affected the economic status
of different countries. People have been observing safety measures such as
social distancing, constant hand washing, using disinfectants, and staying

                                            MANILA: A truck carrying animal feed smashed into the rear of a passenger bus on a remote downhill provincial road in the northern Philippines early Saturday, setting off a series of wrecks that left at least 20 people dead and injured 44 others, police said. The bus driver lost control of his vehicle after the first collision and hit two buses and four vans coming from the opposite direction before toppling over on the narrow downhill road in Quezon province on Luzon island, about 115 kilometers (72 miles) southeast of Manila, Atimonan town police chief Jonar Yupio said. Parts of the bus pinned many of the victims, and others were killed by flying metal debris, including the engine. All those killed — including four children, the truck driver and his assistant — were in either the truck or the first bus that was hit. Social workers said a 1-year-old girl was among the survivors. Rescuer Jun Panuil said he found the baby muddied and covered in blood from other victims on the side of the road near the bus. He said the blood had made rescuers suspect the child was seriously hurt, but she had only a few scratches Yupio said it was dark and raining when the accident occurred early Saturday morning, shortly past midnight. He said the bus and truck involved in the first collision rolled over before stopping on their sides The injured, most of them passengers on the first bus that was hit, were brought to separate hospitals, Yupio said. An investigation has been launched. Road accidents are common in remote areas in the Philippines, largely because of poor vehicle maintenance and bad road conditions.

Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of death, cancer and other diseases in the Philippines. Smokers are not only ones risking illness and deaths from cigarettes: second-hand smoke also kills and weakens.

The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarette altogether. 2. With the Tokyo Olympics fast approaching.

                            3. No. XVIII. A terrorist group called the
Emerald Brigade is based in the State
Asyaland. The government of Asyaland does
not support the terrorist group, but being a
poor country, is powerless to stop it.
The Emerald Brigade launched an attack
on the Philippines firing two missiles that
killed thousands of Filipinos. It then
warned that more attacks were
forthcoming. Through diplomatic channels
the Philippines demanded that Asyaland
stop the Emerald Brigade; otherwise, it will
do whatever is necessary to defend itself.
Receiving reliable intelligence reports of
another imminent attack by the Emarld
Brigae, and it appearing that Asyaland was
incapable of preventing the assault, the
Philippines sent a crack commando team to
Asyaland. The team stayed only for a few
hours in Asyaland, succeeded in killing the
leaders and most of the members of the
Emerald Brigade, then immediately
returned to the Philippines.
(a) Was the Philippine action justified under
the international law principle of self-
defense? explain your answer (3%)
(b) As a consequence of the foregoing
incident, Asyaland charges the Philippines
with violation of Article 2.4 of the United
Nations Charter that prohibits "the threat
or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any
State. The Philippines counters that its
commando team neither took any territory
nor interfered in the political processes of
Asyaland. Which contention is correct?
Reasons (3%)
(c) Assume that the commando team
captured a member of the Emerald Brigade
and brought him back to th Philippines.
The Philippine Government insists that a
special international tribunal should try the
terrorist. On the other hand, the terrorist
argues that terrorism is not an
international crime and, therefore, the
municipal laws of the Philippines, which
recognize access of the accused to
constitutional rights, should apply. Decide

                            11. Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

                            15. MANILA: A truck carrying animal feed smashed into the rear of a passenger bus on a remote downhill provincial road in the northern Philippines early Saturday, setting off a series of wrecks that left at least 20 people dead and injured 44 others, police said. The bus driver lost control of his vehicle after the first collision and hit two buses and four vans coming from the opposite direction before toppling over on the narrow downhill road in Quezon province on Luzon island, about 115 kilometers (72 miles) southeast of Manila, Atimonan town police chief Jonar Yupio said. Parts of the bus pinned many of the victims, and others were killed by flying metal debris, including the engine. All those killed — including four children, the truck driver and his assistant — were in either the truck or the first bus that was hit. Social workers said a 1-year-old girl was among the survivors. Rescuer Jun Panuil said he found the baby muddied and covered in blood from other victims on the side of the road near the bus. He said the blood had made rescuers suspect the child was seriously hurt, but she had only a few scratches Yupio said it was dark and raining when the accident occurred early Saturday morning, shortly past midnight. He said the bus and truck involved in the first collision rolled over before stopping on their sides The injured, most of them passengers on the first bus that was hit, were brought to separate hospitals, Yupio said. An investigation has been launched. Road accidents are common in remote areas in the Philippines, largely because of poor vehicle maintenance and bad road conditions.
