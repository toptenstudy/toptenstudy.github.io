                                            Learning Task 1: Read and analyze the statements. Differentiate the statements. Statement ! The purpose of the project was to determine if Vitamin A tablet have any effect on tomato plants. A total of twelve Rutgers tomato plants each two inches tall were planted in identical individual plastic pots using two cups of potting soil. Each plant received the same amount of water and sunlight during the three week experiment. The twelve plants were divided into four groups of three plants each. One vitamin A tablet was added to each of the three plants in the first group by burying the tablet one inch from the stem and one inch deep. Two vitamin A tablets were added to the second group of three plants in a similar manner. The third group of three plants had three tablets planted in the soil. The fourth group of three plants had no vitamin A tablets added to the soil and served as the control group. The height of each plant was measured and recorded at the start of the experiment and every 7 days thereafter. At the end of the experiment (21 days) the stems were cut across at a height of 3 inches. Experimental groups showed less development and slower growth rates than plants in the control group. The data was analyzed and the conclusion was drawn that giving vitamin A tablets to tomato plants did not improve growth as each of the three experimental groups failed to produce plants that were taller or had thicker stems than those in the control group. Statement ! A device invented by a 14-year-old Filipino hig school student harvests energy from simply walkin Camarines Sur National High School Grade student Modesto Remo Jr. invented the device th generates 6 watts of power from seven minutes walking. The device is also Bluetooth-capable, whi allows it to send information to a smart phon According to Remo, he had the idea to develop th device two years ago in a bid to find alternati sources of energy Guide Question: 3 points each 1. After reading the two statements, what did y observe about it? 2. Compare and contrast statement 1 and 2.​(plss i need it now)</a>

                            2. Learning Task 1: Read and analyze the statements. Differentiate the statements. Statement ! The purpose of the project was to determine if Vitamin A tablet have any effect on tomato plants. A total of twelve Rutgers tomato plants each two inches tall were planted in identical individual plastic pots using two cups of potting soil. Each plant received the same amount of water and sunlight during the three week experiment. The twelve plants were divided into four groups of three plants each. One vitamin A tablet was added to each of the three plants in the first group by burying the tablet one inch from the stem and one inch deep. Two vitamin A tablets were added to the second group of three plants in a similar manner. The third group of three plants had three tablets planted in the soil. The fourth group of three plants had no vitamin A tablets added to the soil and served as the control group. The height of each plant was measured and recorded at the start of the experiment and every 7 days thereafter. At the end of the experiment (21 days) the stems were cut across at a height of 3 inches. Experimental groups showed less development and slower growth rates than plants in the control group. The data was analyzed and the conclusion was drawn that giving vitamin A tablets to tomato plants did not improve growth as each of the three experimental groups failed to produce plants that were taller or had thicker stems than those in the control group. Statement ! A device invented by a 14-year-old Filipino hig school student harvests energy from simply walkin Camarines Sur National High School Grade student Modesto Remo Jr. invented the device th generates 6 watts of power from seven minutes walking.
