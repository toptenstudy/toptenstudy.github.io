                                            THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSES
3. People usually build their houses out of the materials that are easily available to them. In
some areas, most people build their homes out of wood. This is true in parts of North America
and in Scandinavia. These areas have large forests, so wood is easy to get and inexpensive.
In many other areas of Europe, there are few forests left. Stone and brick are cheaper, so
most people build their houses of these materials. In tropical regions, houses are sometimes
made from plants that grow there. For example, in parts of Africa or Asia, houses may be
made out of bamboo. Finally, in the very coldest areas near the Arctic, people make their
homes out of blocks of ice.

                                            Read the following paragraphs to answer the next two questions (Questions 8&amp;9).There is a place forty kilometres north-east of Portland Victoria, which makes for anunusual visit it is Lake Condan Here are to be found remains of abonginal settlementsthe circular stone bases of several hundred huts rock-lined water channels and stonetools chipped from rock not normally found in the area One of the attractions of LakeCondah long ago was its fish and the most startling evidence of abonginal technology andengineering to be found there are the systems built to trap fishWater courses had been constructed by redirecting streams, building stone sides and evenscraping out new channels. At strategic spots, they piled rocks across the water courses tocreate weirs and build funnels to channel eels and fish into conical baskets. This is an eelfishing technique which has hardly changed to the present day Beside some of the largertraps, there are the outlines of rectangular, stone-lined ponds, probably to hold fish andkeep them freshOn the bluffs overlooking the lake, stone circles are all that remain of ancient dwellings Notall of the stones were quamed locally. The huts vary in size, but all have gaps for doorwayslocated on the lee side, away from the prevailing wind. One theory is that the stone wallswere only waist to shoulder high, with the top roofed by branches and possibly packed withmudThe site presents a picture of a semi-settled people quite different from the stereotype ofnomadic hunter-gatherers of the desert.Question 8The word 'stereotype' as used in the above passage means:A: distant cultureB: opposite pictureC: electronic print versionD: standard viewE: None of theseQuestion 9Lake Condah is seen as unusual, mainly because:A: it is so close to a main townB. there are remains of buildings still to be seenC: it reveals a society that was at least partly settled and had building and engineering skillsD: there is evidence that some of the building stone was importedE: it shows the lake dwellers were totally reliant on fish for a food source.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The earliest records of pre-colonial architecture in the Philippines are rock shelters and caves in Palawan. Early Filipinos are nomadic since they are constantly in search for food through hunting or fishing so they mainly rely on nature when creating shelter and do not need to build permanent structures.In the late 20th century, modern architecture with straight lines and functional aspects was introduced, particularly in the Brutalist architecture that characterized government-built structures done in the Marcos period.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Natural stone was one of the first building materials ever used. For many of the same reasons that made it an important building material over thousands of years, it still remains as one of the best today.</p><p></p><p>Stone is immensely popular, partly because it has countless applications as a building material. From commercial construction like buildings and bridges to backyard DIY projects like garden walls and pathways, stone has earned its place as a time-tested resource. Take in these seven benefits of natural stone building materials:</p><p></p><p>It ages beautifully. Arguably, stone looks better with age. Stone retains its natural beauty and has an extremely long lifespan. Some stone attains its full elegance with a little age, and stone can look as stunning after a hundred years as the day it was installed.</p><p></p><p>Low environmental impact. Stone has many “green” characteristics that few materials can match. No energy is needed to manufacture stone, only for quarrying and processing. Blasting and mining techniques have greatly improved. Stone contains no pollutants, releases no chemicals, and needs no substances to be used in construction.</p><p></p><p>The low-maintenance material. Stone needs very little maintenance or upkeep once it is used in building. There’s no need to paint or finish and it’s extremely easy to clean. Even decades-old stone can be polished and restored with minimal cost</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSES
3. People usually build their houses out of the materials that are easily available to them. In
some areas, most people build their homes out of wood. This is true in parts of North America
and in Scandinavia. These areas have large forests, so wood is easy to get and inexpensive.
In many other areas of Europe, there are few forests left. Stone and brick are cheaper, so
most people build their houses of these materials. In tropical regions, houses are sometimes
made from plants that grow there. For example, in parts of Africa or Asia, houses may be
made out of bamboo. Finally, in the very coldest areas near the Arctic, people make their
homes out of blocks of ice.
a. Materials used for houses
b. The wooden houses of Scandinavia

At strategic spots, they piled rocks across the water courses tocreate weirs and build funnels to channel eels and fish into conical baskets. This is an eelfishing technique which has hardly changed to the present day Beside some of the largertraps, there are the outlines of rectangular, stone-lined ponds, probably to hold fish andkeep them freshOn the bluffs overlooking the lake, stone circles are all that remain of ancient dwellings Notall of the stones were quamed locally. The huts vary in size, but all have gaps for doorwayslocated on the lee side, away from the prevailing wind. One theory is that the stone wallswere only waist to shoulder high, with the top roofed by branches and possibly packed withmudThe site presents a picture of a semi-settled people quite different from the stereotype ofnomadic hunter-gatherers of the desert.Question 8The word 'stereotype' as used in the above passage means:A: distant cultureB: opposite pictureC: electronic print versionD: standard viewE: None of theseQuestion 9Lake Condah is seen as unusual, mainly because:A: it is so close to a main townB. there are remains of buildings still to be seenC: it reveals a society that was at least partly settled and had building and engineering skillsD: there is evidence that some of the building stone was importedE: it shows the lake dwellers were totally reliant on fish for a food source.​</h2><br />

                            17. 1. What benefits are derived in using artificial and natural stones in building construction​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Natural stone was one of the first building materials ever used. For many of the same reasons that made it an important building material over thousands of years, it still remains as one of the best today.</p><p></p><p>Stone is immensely popular, partly because it has countless applications as a building material. From commercial construction like buildings and bridges to backyard DIY projects like garden walls and pathways, stone has earned its place as a time-tested resource. Take in these seven benefits of natural stone building materials:</p><p></p><p>It ages beautifully. Arguably, stone looks better with age. Stone retains its natural beauty and has an extremely long lifespan. Some stone attains its full elegance with a little age, and stone can look as stunning after a hundred years as the day it was installed.</p><p></p><p>Low environmental impact. Stone has many “green” characteristics that few materials can match. No energy is needed to manufacture stone, only for quarrying and processing. Blasting and mining techniques have greatly improved. Stone contains no pollutants, releases no chemicals, and needs no substances to be used in construction.</p><p></p><p>The low-maintenance material. Stone needs very little maintenance or upkeep once it is used in building. There’s no need to paint or finish and it’s extremely easy to clean. Even decades-old stone can be polished and restored with minimal cost</p><br />
