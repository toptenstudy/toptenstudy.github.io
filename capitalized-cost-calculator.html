                                            MTC Corporation's top management wants to measure the company's overall  cost of capital. The following data were gathered by their finance department:  • The firm's common stock is currently selling for P90.00 per share. The firm expects  to pay cash dividends of P7.00 per share next year. The firm's dividends have been  growing at an annual rate of 6%, and this growth is expected to continue into the  future. The stock must be under-priced by P7.00 per share, and flotation costs are  expected to amount to P5.00 per share. The firm can sell new common stock  under these terms. Furthermore, the company's finance department identified  that the risk-free rate is at six percent; the market return is ten percent; and the  firm's beta is 1.9444445.  • The firm is in the 40% tax bracket. The firm can raise debt by selling P1,000-par  value, 8% coupon interest rate, 20-year bonds on which annual interest payments  will be made. To sell the issue, an average discount of P30.00 per bond would have  to be given. The firm also must pay flotation costs of P30.00 per bond.  • The firm can sell 8% preferred stock at its P95-per-share par value. The cost of  issuing and selling the preferred stock is expected to be P5.00 per share. Preferred  stock can be sold under these terms.  The firm uses the weights shown in the following table, which are based on the target  capital structure proportions to calculate its weighted average cost of capital.
SOURCE OF CAPITAL          AMOUNT 
Long-term debt                       90,000 
Preferred stock                       60,000
Common stock                      150,000

                            6. MTC Corporation's top management wants to measure the company's overall  cost of capital. The following data were gathered by their finance department:  • The firm's common stock is currently selling for P90.00 per share. The firm expects  to pay cash dividends of P7.00 per share next year. The firm's dividends have been  growing at an annual rate of 6%, and this growth is expected to continue into the  future. The stock must be under-priced by P7.00 per share, and flotation costs are  expected to amount to P5.00 per share. The firm can sell new common stock  under these terms. Furthermore, the company's finance department identified  that the risk-free rate is at six percent; the market return is ten percent; and the  firm's beta is 1.9444445.  • The firm is in the 40% tax bracket. The firm can raise debt by selling P1,000-par  value, 8% coupon interest rate, 20-year bonds on which annual interest payments  will be made. To sell the issue, an average discount of P30.00 per bond would have  to be given. The firm also must pay flotation costs of P30.00 per bond.  • The firm can sell 8% preferred stock at its P95-per-share par value. The cost of  issuing and selling the preferred stock is expected to be P5.00 per share. Preferred  stock can be sold under these terms.  The firm uses the weights shown in the following table, which are based on the target  capital structure proportions to calculate its weighted average cost of capital.
SOURCE OF CAPITAL          AMOUNT 
Long-term debt                       90,000 
Preferred stock                       60,000
Common stock                      150,000

1. What is the company's after-tax cost of debt?
2. What is the company's cost of preferred stocks?
3. What is the company's cost of retained earnings?
4. What is the company's weighted average cost of capital using retained earnings?
5. What is the company's weighted average cost of capital using new issue common stocks?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The after-tax cost of debt can be calculated as follows:</p><p>Coupon rate = 8%</p><p>Discount = P30.00</p><p>Flotation cost = P30.00</p><p>Net proceeds = P1,000 - P30 - P30 = P940</p><p>Effective cost of debt = coupon rate x (1 - tax rate) = 8% x (1 - 0.40) = 4.8%</p><p>After-tax cost of debt = effective cost of debt x (1 - discount / net proceeds) = 4.8% x (1 - 30 / 940) = 4.36%</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the company's after-tax cost of debt is 4.36%.</p><p></p><p>2. The cost of preferred stocks can be calculated as follows:</p><p>Cost of preferred stocks = dividend / net proceeds - flotation cost</p><p>Dividend = P95.00 x 8% = P7.60</p><p>Flotation cost = P5.00</p><p>Net proceeds = P95.00 - P5.00 = P90.00</p><p>Cost of preferred stocks = 7.60 / 90 - 5.00 / 90 = 0.0467 or 4.67%</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the company's cost of preferred stocks is 4.67%.</p><p></p><p>3. The cost of retained earnings can be calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as follows:</p><p>Cost of retained earnings = risk-free rate + beta x (market return - risk-free rate)</p><p>Risk-free rate = 6%</p><p>Beta = 1.9444445</p><p>Market return = 10%</p><p>Cost of retained earnings = 6% + 1.9444445 x (10% - 6%) = 13.78%</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the company's cost of retained earnings is 13.78%.</p><p></p><p>4. The weighted average cost of capital using retained earnings can be calculated as follows:</p><p>WACC = (cost of debt x weight of debt) + (cost of preferred stocks x weight of preferred stocks) + (cost of retained earnings x weight of common stock)</p><p>Weight of debt = 90,000 / 300,000 = 0.3</p><p>Weight of preferred stocks = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2</p><p>Weight of common stock = 150,000 / 300,000 = 0.5</p><p>WACC = (4.36% x 0.3) + (4.67% x 0.2) + (13.78% x 0.5) = 9.79%</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the company's weighted average cost of capital using retained earnings is 9.79%.</p><p></p><p>5. The weighted average cost of capital using new issue common stocks can be calculated as follows:</p><p>Cost of new issue common stocks = (dividend / net proceeds - flotation cost) / (1 - flotation cost / market price)</p><p>Dividend = P7.00 x 1.06 = P7.42</p><p>Flotation cost = P5.00</p><p>Net proceeds = P90.00 - P5.00 = P85.00</p><p>Market price = P90.00 + P7.00 / (10% - 6%) - P5.00 = P90.71</p><p>Cost of new issue common stocks = (7.42 / 85 - 5.00 / 90.71) / (1 - 5.00 / 90.71) = 14.08%</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the company's weighted average cost of capital using new issue common stocks is 14.08%.</p><br />

1.
The weather, climate, floods and others can decrease or increase product supply.
Nature has a major impact on the supply of products.
2.
There is an increase in quantity supply when there is an increase in the number of sellers.
Example of this is the wage of the laborers
3.
If the price of the product increases the demand will go down.
The cost of production pertains to the value of the factors of production like land, labor and capital used in processing the product.
4.
A substitute good refers to a product that can be used in replacement of another product.
If customers expect that price will increase in the future, the demand for a product at present will increase.
5.
Due to gender, women demand more lipstick and blush-on than men.
The increase in population/number of consumers is equated to an increase in demand for products.
6.
If an advertising campaign is successful, people tend to buy more of a product.
Consumer tastes are shaped by the way products are marketed to them.
7.
The demand is considered to be elastic
Common examples of products with high elasticity are luxury items and consumer discretionary items.
8.
Economic measure of how responsive the quality demanded for a good service is to a change in income.
Income Elasticity demand as one of the main types of demand elasticity.
9.
If the price of something goes up, the demand for it will go down.
The law of Supply
10.
The elasticity of demand is a measure of how demand reacts to price changes.
It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demand by the percentage change in price.</h2><br />

Against - The second statement talks about the wage of laborers, which is not related to an increase in quantity supply due to an increase in the number of sellers.</p><p>3. For - The cost of production is a factor that can impact the price of a product and, in turn, affect the demand for it.</p><p>4. For - If customers expect the price of a product to increase in the future, the demand for it at present may increase as they try to avoid paying more later.</p><p>5. Against - The statement makes a generalization about women and men's preferences for cosmetics, which may not be true in all cases.</p><p>6. For - Successful advertising campaigns can indeed influence consumer behavior and increase the demand for a product.</p><p>7. For - Products with high elasticity, like luxury items, tend to have a more elastic demand.</p><p>8. For - Income elasticity of demand is indeed a measure of how responsive the demand for a good or service is to a change in income.</p><p>9. For - The law of supply states that if the price of something goes up, the quantity supplied will also go up. This is different from the law of demand.</p><p>10.
