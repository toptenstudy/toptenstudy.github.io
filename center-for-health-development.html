Deinstitutionalization is a mental health policy that emerged in the 1960s. The policy re-directed

As a highly-urbanized city, Tacloban has its own local government unit (LGU) that is separate from the provincial government. The city is home to a population of approximately 242,000 people.</p><p></p><p>In terms of economic development, Tacloban City is mainly focused on agriculture, commercial centers, and industries. The city has a thriving commercial center, with many shopping malls and retail stores catering to both locals and tourists. The city's agriculture industry is also quite strong, with farmers producing a variety of crops such as rice, corn, and vegetables.</p><p></p><p>However, there is still room for improvement in terms of economic development. The city's industries could be expanded to attract more investors and provide more job opportunities for locals. More investment in technology and innovation could also be beneficial for the city's overall economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the city could benefit from more recreational facilities such as parks and sports centers to enhance the quality of life of residents. Improvements could also be made to the transportation system, particularly the public transportation system, to make it more organized and efficient.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the city's health and education facilities could be improved to provide better access to quality healthcare and education for all residents. Overall, Tacloban City has the potential to be a thriving urban center, but there is still much work to be done to fully realize this potential.</p><br />

Paragraph 1
Deinstitutionalization is a mental health policy that emerged in the 1960s. The policy re-directed
care of persons with severe mental disorders from state mental hospitals to community-based treatment
settings. Based on the policy of deinstitutionalization, many state hospitals were closed and replaced by
community mental health centers or residential treatment facilities.

This is because the paragraph provides a clear definition of deinstitutionalization and then goes on to describe how it works in practice, including its impact on state hospitals and the development of community-based treatment options.
