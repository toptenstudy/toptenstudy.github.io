                                            Physical and Chemical Changes in Our EnvironmentWater is one of the essential substances in our planet. All species needwater to live. When it evaporates from the surface of the earth. It rises into clouds,cools and condenses, and falls again as rain or snow in the precipitation processon the surface. It cycles in the atmosphere. Snow in the mountains directly turnsinto water vapor due to high vapor pressure. Unfortunately, the cycle of water in ourenvironment is disturbed due to human activities.Fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil, and, natural gas when bumed, producecarbon dioxide gas (CO). Carbon dioxide is a primary greenhouse gas that trapsthe heat from the sun in our atmosphere. The trapping of heat by these substancesis known as the greenhouse effect. The temperature of the atmosphere increasesas more greenhouse gases are released. This phenomenon is called globalwarming. The greenhouse effect and global warming are the contributing factorsto climate change. Strong typhoons, floods, and severe droughts are the results ofthe changing climate. The Philippines and all of the countries in the world areexperiencing the effects of climate change. Human activities contribute to pollutionPollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NO.) react withrainwater producing acid rain. Acid rain affects both living and nonliving things. Itcauses yellowing of the plant's leaves, corrosion of metals, and leaching of marblestructures.Think About This:1. Write down all the physical and chemical processes that you encountered as youread the article.2. How can phase changes in water help organisms in the environment?3. As a student, how will you help solve the problems about climate change?​</a>

Natural outdoor air pollution includes oxides of sulfur and nitrogen from volcanoes. 3.	Deforestation is one source of land pollution. 4.	Mining is a source of air pollution. 5.	Reducing the usage of non-biodegradable materials, such as plastic shopping bags is one way of minimizing land pollution. 6.	One way to reduce waste materials in the environment is to burn them. 7.	Ozone is formed from the reaction of nitrogen oxides and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. 8.	Carbon monoxide is a gas coming from vehicles that is necessary for plant photosynthesis. 9.	Lead comes from fuel combustion; electric utilities and industrial processes as well as occurrences like volcanoes. 10.	Ozone is a gas that occurs both at ground-level and in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. 11.	One of the issues of air pollution in the Philippines is the increasing number of vehicles. 12.	One way to counter water pollution is proper sewage treatment and management. 13.	Acid rain is point source pollution. 14.	VOCs are precursor to acid rain. 15.

                            7. Physical and Chemical Changes in Our EnvironmentWater is one of the essential substances in our planet. All species needwater to live. When it evaporates from the surface of the earth. It rises into clouds,cools and condenses, and falls again as rain or snow in the precipitation processon the surface. It cycles in the atmosphere. Snow in the mountains directly turnsinto water vapor due to high vapor pressure. Unfortunately, the cycle of water in ourenvironment is disturbed due to human activities.Fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil, and, natural gas when bumed, producecarbon dioxide gas (CO). Carbon dioxide is a primary greenhouse gas that trapsthe heat from the sun in our atmosphere. The trapping of heat by these substancesis known as the greenhouse effect. The temperature of the atmosphere increasesas more greenhouse gases are released. This phenomenon is called globalwarming. The greenhouse effect and global warming are the contributing factorsto climate change. Strong typhoons, floods, and severe droughts are the results ofthe changing climate. The Philippines and all of the countries in the world areexperiencing the effects of climate change. Human activities contribute to pollutionPollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NO.) react withrainwater producing acid rain. Acid rain affects both living and nonliving things. Itcauses yellowing of the plant's leaves, corrosion of metals, and leaching of marblestructures.Think About This:1.
