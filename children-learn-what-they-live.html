                    <p>Children Learn What They Live By Dorothy Law Nolte, Ph.D. If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn. If children live with hostility, they learn to fight. If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive. If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves. If children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy. If children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy. If children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty. If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence. If children live with tolerance, they learn patience. If children live with praise, they learn appreciation. If children live with acceptance, they learn to love. If children live with approval, they learn to like themselves. If children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal. If children live with sharing, they learn generosity. If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness. If children live with fairness, they learn justice. If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect. If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them. If children live with friendliness, they learn the world is a nice place in which to live. If children live with serenity, they will live with peace of mind. QUESTION: select two favorute lines in the poem by dorothy nolte and explain them​</p>

“Educational Challenges and Opportunities of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic” (Excerpt)
We are living amidst what is potentially one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education, a gigantic educational crisis. As of March 28, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than 1.6 billion children and youth to be out of school in 161 countries. This is close to 80% of the world’s enrolled students. We were already experiencing a global learning crisis, as many students were in school, but were not learning the fundamental skills needed for life. The World Bank’s “Learning Poverty” indicator – the % of children who cannot read and understand at age 10 – stood at 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries – before the outbreak started. This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes even more if we do not act fast.
What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have an immediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning; (2) Increased dropout rates; (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day. Moreover, most countries have very unequal education systems, and these negative impacts will be felt disproportionately by poor children. When it rains, it pours for them.

This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes evenmore if we do not act fast.What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have animmediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning (2) Increaseddropout rates: (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day.

                            1. Children Learn What They Live By Dorothy Law Nolte, Ph.D. If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn. If children live with hostility, they learn to fight. If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive. If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves. If children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy. If children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy. If children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty. If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence. If children live with tolerance, they learn patience. If children live with praise, they learn appreciation. If children live with acceptance, they learn to love. If children live with approval, they learn to like themselves. If children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal. If children live with sharing, they learn generosity. If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness. If children live with fairness, they learn justice. If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect. If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them. If children live with friendliness, they learn the world is a nice place in which to live. If children live with serenity, they will live with peace of mind. QUESTION: select two favorute lines in the poem by dorothy nolte and explain them​</h2><br />

                            3. Essay on children learn what they live with</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Children do not learn through what parents preach but children learn through the action of their parents. Therefore, parents must be very careful about what they do to their children and how they behave in front of them.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Criticism He/She Learns to Condemn</strong></p><p>Criticism can have a very bad effect on the growth, development, and thinking of children. Parents cannot even imagine how bad its effects could be. It affects their overall personality. As children absorb everything that they are told during the early childhood years very easily, the criticism may seep deep inside them. What they hear in form of criticism may become their actual personality and surely will come out in form of condemnation from them.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Hostility He/She Learns to Fight</strong></p><p>A loving and caring atmosphere is what children need to grow up into well-balanced individuals. If they are surrounded with hostility, they may not be able to develop the qualities like empathy, friendliness, and a caring attitude. Hostility will make children aggressive and they will learn to fight without thinking about what is right and what is wrong.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Ridicule He/She Learns to be Shy</strong></p><p>If children are constantly subjected to ridicule their self-esteem and confidence are crushed. Lack of self-esteem and confidence will give rise to shyness in them. If children become shy and introverted, they may face a lot of difficulties while walking the path of success in life.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Shame He/She Learns to Feel Guilty</strong></p><p>Children are innocent; they do not know the difference between right and wrong. Due to constant shaming, they will develop guilt which will never let them live peacefully. Guilt may be responsible for stress and tension in them which may also affect their health.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Tolerance He/She Learns to be Patient</strong></p><p>Patience is a very important trait that every parent must develop in their children. It is possible to foster patience in children only if parents show tolerance. It does not mean that giving in to their unreasonable demands. It means that parents should not get hyper when children make any mistake or behave badly. They must provide the right guidance by being calm and showing tolerance.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Encouragement He/She Learns Confidence</strong></p><p>Encouragement from parents is very important for children to succeed in life. Parents can play an important role in encouraging children and boosting their confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Praise He/She Learns to Appreciate</strong></p><p>Praising children for the right things and at right time can help them learn to appreciate the good deeds and hard work of others. If they are praised for good behavior or their hard work they will repeat the same behavior for earning your praise.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Fairness He/She Learns Justice</strong></p><p>If you practice fairness with your child and if you teach your child to be fair, he will never be unjust to others throughout his life.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Security He/She Learns to Have Faith</strong></p><p>When you always stand by your child, he will develop a sense of security. In the future when he has to take any important decision or if he is in distress he will surely have faith in you. He will have faith that you have solutions to all his problems.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Approval He/She Learns to Like Himself/Herself</strong></p><p>Let your child follow his dreams. Do not burden him with your expectations. Never force him to do something in life to satisfy your ego. Only then your child can live his life to the fullest and learn to like himself.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Acceptance and Friendship He/She Learns to Find Love in the World</strong></p><p>Shower your unconditional love on your child. Be there for him always. Celebrate his every little achievement. Teach good values to him and accept him for, however, he is. Do not compare him with other children. Let him grow in your love and care.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

“Educational Challenges and Opportunities of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic” (Excerpt)
We are living amidst what is potentially one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education, a gigantic educational crisis. As of March 28, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than 1.6 billion children and youth to be out of school in 161 countries. This is close to 80% of the world’s enrolled students. We were already experiencing a global learning crisis, as many students were in school, but were not learning the fundamental skills needed for life. The World Bank’s “Learning Poverty” indicator – the % of children who cannot read and understand at age 10 – stood at 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries – before the outbreak started. This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes even more if we do not act fast.
What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have an immediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning; (2) Increased dropout rates; (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day. Moreover, most countries have very unequal education systems, and these negative impacts will be felt disproportionately by poor children. When it rains, it pours for them.

                            21. Additional ActivitiesHave you heard about the “feral children"? These are children found livingalone, usually in the wild, without humans taking care of them. For those found inthe forests, some say that animals took care and raised the children. Maybe you haveseen the movie Tarzan or heard of the character Mowgli from The Jungle Book. Theyare examples of feral children that were eventually brought back to society.Do you think humans can really live outside of society? Imagine being raisedby an animal. What would happen when, after long years of living with animals, aperson is placed in society? What would be the challenges? Do you think that personcould forget what he "learned" from the animals?Think and try to imagine the situation of a feral child. Write your thoughts orreflections about the questions about.pa helppp namn po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, human can live outside the society if their needs are being taken care of. Human raised by animal would be ignoramus. In my opinion, if a feral child would be brought back in the society it might cause him psychological problems. The feral child's animal-like behavior, inability to communicate verbally because of being isolated from human would be a challenge. A feral child's animalistic behavior would be imprinted on him/her forever. Once a feral child's been taken care by people it would change him/her over the time and can even learn how to live a normal life.</p><br />
