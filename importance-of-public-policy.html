                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Impact of Cultural, Social, and Community Environments on Home Care</p><p></p><p>Steven M. Albert</p><p></p><p>The home environment is critical for maintaining health and well-being among the medically ill and people living with disabilities. Access to appropriate supportive care technologies and home health care services depends in part on where homes are located, what sorts of spaces are available for care in the home, and whether basic services (such as utilities) are reliable. These aspects of home environments are difficult to measure, even when features of homes are narrowly defined and only a single attribute, such as safety, is considered (Gitlin, 2003). Measurement challenges become more complex when considering that each of these environmental features also has a cultural or social component. Homes are located in neighborhoods, where home health care providers may not feel welcome or safe because of crime in a low-income neighborhood and discrimination or suspicion in a higher income one. Homes differ in their spaces available for care but also in the willingness of families to make these spaces available, adapt them as needed, and work with home health staff to provide care. Also, utilities, telephone service, and access to services differ by community, with some communities well serviced and others shortchanged. Thus, the home environment is nested in social and cultural layers that may lead to different home care outcomes, even with similar patients and common home environments (Barris et al., 1985).</p><p>The cultural component is immediately visible in family adaptation to home care. Families differ in the degree to which they reorganize themselves and their living spaces to accommodate care for the disabled or medically unstable (Albert, 1990), with different tolerance for disorder and different strategies for reducing such disorder (Rubinstein, 1990).</p><p></p><p>Page 248</p><p></p><p>Suggested Citation:"11 Impact of Cultural, Social, and Community Environments on Home Care--Steven M.

                            6. Make a reflection about the statements below and answer it on a separate sheet of paper. Be guided with the rubrics below. "Rules and policies are important in the proper and orderly functioning of a society. The legislature becomes important in this regard." How about in your family? Who creates rules? What are some of these rules? Do you think it is necessary to follow these rules? Why? The participation of citizens in matters of public concern is fundamental in any democratic system. The government recognizes the participation and the indispensable role of the youth in public and civic affairs. That means, you can communicate the Congress directly on issues that you want to raise. Remember, solutions to problems can be in the form of legislation or a law. Guide Questions: 1. What are the current issues or problems that need to be addressed? 2. How can your representative in the Congress be of help in this regard?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In my family, my parents create the rules and policies. Some of these rules include curfews, household chores, and manners. It is necessary to follow these rules because they help maintain order and harmony within the family.</p><p></p><p>In regards to public concerns, I think that the current issues that need to be addressed are climate change, education, and healthcare. My representative in Congress can be of help by proposing and supporting legislation that addresses these issues. For example, they can support laws that promote renewable energy and conservation, increase funding for education, and improve access to healthcare for all citizens. It is important for me to communicate my concerns to my representative so that they can take action on these important issues.</p><br />

To convince the reader, use emphasis markers to show importance about whatare trying to pinpoint. If you have trouble finding a topic, answer one of the followquestions1. What school policy would you change or enact if you could?2. Who is the greatest historical figure of all time in the Philippines?3. Should public school students wear uniforms?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I would change the wearing of school uniforms due to the fact that some students are not comfortable wearing them and that would lead them to not focusing properly in school. Although we still need to follow the dress code. And most people now a days express how they feel through the way they dress. Feeling comfortable makes us focus more and it makes us be ourselves better. </p><p>2. In my opinion, it is Jose Rizal because even our past heroes said that Jose Rizal's sacrifice was the biggest one of all. He persuaded filipino's to fight harder and dream bigger through his novels, stories, etc. He was very smart and he helped filipino's so much, let's not forget that he loves Philippines so much. </p><p>3. For me, I think no because as I said earlier they might not be comfortable and some students can't afford uniforms. Although it is up to them because I am just stating my opinions and probably they like uniforms better, but wearing what you're comfortable with helps a lot because your mind is gonna get motivated and it will want to learn more. </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps </p><br />

THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC LIFE
Every citizen has the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, including the right to stand for elected office, to participate in the formulation of policies affecting their welfare, and to have equal access to all levels of public service and employment in public functions, including serving in the police and military, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the paragraph, every citizen has the right to participate in public life, including the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs. This includes the right to run for elected office, participate in policymaking that affects their well-being, and have equal access to all levels of public service and employment in public functions, including serving in the police and military, without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p>This paragraph is significant because it emphasizes the value of democracy and the inclusion of all people in public life. Every citizen in a democratic society should have the right to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This includes the right not only to vote, but also to run for office and have an equal say in policymaking.</p><p>Furthermore, the paragraph emphasizes the significance of equality and nondiscrimination. Individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities should have equal access to public services and employment in public functions. This ensures that every citizen has the opportunity to contribute to their society's development and that their talents and skills are not overlooked due to discriminatory factors.</p><p>Lastly, the right to participate in public life is essential for a democratic society to function. It allows for the inclusion of various points of view and ensures that every citizen has an equal voice in decision-making processes. Non-discrimination is an important component of this right because it ensures that every citizen has the opportunity to contribute to their society and reach their full potential without fear of discrimination or exclusion.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why is public administration important?</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Very important for anything about public organization and politics. They both have to know and relate with public administration. It because public administration have a principle that it should give and make benefits for public or citizens. Yes. Public organization should've give public services based on its minimum service standard since the public services are given to any citizens because it has no value to get it. Another reason why does public organization have to relate to public administration is without public organization, any resources that public organizations have will be used for private and personal benefit, no accountability and responsibility for public. Besides its budgets also from taxes, right? So public administration is a standard or basic for government to give the public services for their citizens.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least, it also relates with politics. Some of people that similar to public administration are familiar with political-administrative dichotomy[1]. But besides of those theories, I will share my opinion why politics also need public administration. First, it because of politician accountability. Some of politician are being politician just because they want powers, but the power should be use for public benefit and make the system more affordable to its ecology, not for personal interests. Second, politics is about negotiation between politician and stakeholders, so it needs public administration so that politician have to consider with public needs, also politician have to negotiate their affairs to make benefit for each other (public, politician, and stakeholder). The state civil apparatus without politician will hard to get the midpoint deals because based on Max Weber's theory called Weberian or classic/traditional public administration, an ideal bureaucracy has some features characteristic[2]:</p><p></p><p>HierarchiesImpersonal relationshipOfficial rules</p><p></p><p>And its characteristics make the bureaucracy become rigid and inflexible. So politician needs public administration for make the bureaucracy more flexible but still based on its law or rules.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) refers to the efforts and measures taken to reduce the vulnerabilities and potential impacts of natural and man-made disasters on communities, as well as to improve the capacity of individuals and organizations to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events. Public policies play a crucial role in facilitating and enforcing DRRM efforts, as they provide the legal and institutional framework for disaster management activities, as well as set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in this process.</p><p></p><p>There are several reasons why it is important to abide by public policies on DRRM:</p><p></p><p>Ensuring public safety: Public policies on DRRM help to ensure that communities are prepared and equipped to handle disasters, which in turn helps to reduce the risk of injury and loss of life. By following these policies, individuals can take steps to protect themselves and their families from harm, as well as help their communities to be more resilient in the face of disasters.</p><p></p><p>Protecting property and infrastructure: Disasters can cause significant damage to property and infrastructure, leading to costly repairs and reconstruction. Public policies on DRRM help to mitigate this damage by promoting the use of structural and non-structural measures to reduce the risk of disaster, such as building codes, land-use planning, and emergency preparedness plans.</p><p></p><p>Reducing economic impacts: Disasters can have significant economic impacts, including lost productivity, damage to businesses and infrastructure, and disrupted supply chains. Public policies on DRRM help to minimize these impacts by encouraging the use of risk assessment tools to identify and prioritize areas at risk, as well as by promoting the development of contingency plans to minimize the disruption of essential services.</p><p></p><p>Promoting sustainable development: DRRM is an important aspect of sustainable development, as it helps to reduce the risks and impacts of disasters on vulnerable communities and ecosystems. By abiding by public policies on DRRM, individuals and organizations can contribute to the development of more resilient and sustainable communities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is important to abide by public policies on DRRM in order to ensure public safety, protect property and infrastructure, reduce economic impacts, and promote sustainable development. By following these policies, individuals and organizations can play a crucial role in reducing the risks and impacts of disasters, and helping communities to become more resilient and prepared for the future</p><strong>Explanation:</strong>PA BRAINLIEST PO <br />
