How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic.

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</h2><br />

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Celestial bodies like asteroids and comets are “time capsules” that contain information about the history of our solar system, making them interesting targets of studies. The main difference between asteroid and comet is their composition. Asteroids and comets are debris left over from the formation of the moon and planets. Comets are located in the outermost regions of the solar system, while, asteroids are located in a belt between Jupiter and Mars. Occasionally, comets and asteroids change their orbital path due to gravitational disturbances, sometimes bringing them close to a planet. Craters on the moon and planets are evidence of the history of impacts with comets and asteroids.</p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Comets are made of dust, ice, and rock materials, while asteroids are composed of rocky materials and metals. Both the celestial bodies were formed 4.6 billion years ago. Asteroids were formed much closer to the sun where it was impossible for the ice to remain solid. Comets were formed farther away from the sun where the ice remained solid. Comets that approach the Sun lose material with its every orbit around the sun as its ice melts and vaporizes to form the tail known as the coma.</p><p></p><p>Asteroid</p><p>Asteroid orbit the Sun and are small bodies on the solar system. They are made up of metals and rocks and also consist of organic compounds. They are similar to comets but don’t have a coma-like comet. Asteroids tend to have shorter and elliptical orbits. Astronomers have discovered millions of asteroids some that measure hundreds of kilometers across and some as small as dust particles.</p><p></p><p>Comet</p><p>Comets also orbit the Sun and are relatively small bodies of the solar system. When comets approach the sun, some part of their ice melts. When some parts of the ice melt, the other materials vaporize due to the heat of the sun. This results in a glowing halo that extends outwards as though sailing through space. The ice and compounds like ammonia and methane develop a fuzzy cloud-like shell known as the coma. This forms a notable difference between comets and asteroids.  </p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Now that we have an idea of what asteroid and comets are let us write down the differences between them in a tabular column. The comparison between asteroid and comet in tabular form is given below.</p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid and Comet</p><p>Asteroid	Comet</p><p>Asteroids have an elliptical orbit	Comets have an eccentric orbit.</p><p>It is made of metals and rocks	Made of rocks, hydrocarbons, and ice</p><p>Do not produce a coma or tail atmosphere	Thin, temporary atmospheric tail when close to the Sun.</p><p>The orbital period is 1 to 100 years	The orbital periods are 75 to more than 100,000 years.</p><p>1 to larger than 100 kilometers in size	1 to 10 kilometer in size (nucleus only)</p><p></p><p>Hope it's helps</p><p>Don't forget to Love Rate and make me Brainliest</p><p></p><br />
