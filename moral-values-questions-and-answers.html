                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

Humanga siPari Sibyla sa pagkabigkas ni Padre Damaso at siPadre Martin ay napalunok ng laway dahil sa alamniyang higit na maagaling ang pambungad na iyon sakanyang sariling sermon.Nagpugay ang pari sa mga nagsimba. Lumingon siyasa likod at itinuro ang pintong malaki. Inakala ngsakristan yaon ay isang pagturo sa kanya upang isaraang lahat ng mga pintuan. Nagalinlangan anp alperes,iniisip niyang tatayo at aalis na. Ngunit, hindi niyamagawa sapagkat nagsisimula ng magsalita angpredikador.Nakita ni pari Damaso na napakunot  noo angalperes sa kanyang tinuran. Ang mga bahaging ito ngsermon ay ipinahayag ni Padre Damaso sa wikangKastila, kaya hindi maiintiihan ng mga Indiyo. Angtanging naunawaan ng karamihan ay ang salitangguwardiya sibil, tulisan, San Diego at San Francisco.Umasim din ang muha ng alperes, kaya inakala ngmarami na pinagalitan siya ni Pari Damaso dahil sahindi pagkakahuli nito sa mga tulisan.Nang mabanggit naman niya ang tungkol sa patenteupang tukuyin ang pagwawalang  bahala ng mga taosa kasalanan, isang lalaki ang namumutlang tumindigat nagtago sa kumpiskalan. Inaantok ang mganakikinig. Si Maria ay hindi nakikinig sa sermonsapagkat abala siya sa pagtingin sa kinaroroonan niIbarra na malapit lamang sa kanya. Nang simulan nasa tagalog ang misa, ito ay tumagal ng tumagal.Lumilisya na si Padre Damaso sa sermon niyasapagkat puro panunumbat, sumpa, atpagtutungayaw ang isinasumbulat niya. Dahildito,pati si Ibarra ay nabalisa lalo nang turulin ng pariang tungkol sa makasalanang hindi nangungumpisalna namamatay sa bilangguan na walang sakramentosa simbahan. Naging kabagot-bagot na ang sermon,kung kaya nagpakuliling na si Padre Salvi upanghuminto na si Damaso. Pero, sumabak pa rin sapagsasalita ng may kalahating oras. Habangisinasagawa ang misa, isang lalaki (ito ay si Elias) anglumapit kay Ibarra at nagbabala tungkol sa gagawingpagdiriwang sa paaralan. Kailangang maging maingat,anya si Ibarra sa pagbaba sa hukay at huwag lalapit sabato sapagkat maari siyang mamamatay.

                            6. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                            19. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.
