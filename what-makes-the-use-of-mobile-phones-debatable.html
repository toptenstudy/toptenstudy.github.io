                                            Directions: Read the argumentative text below and answer the questions that follow.Use of Mobile Phones in Schools     The use of mobile or cell phones in learning institutions, specifically schools, has elicited debate and bitter arguments, not only in the United States of America, but in the world as a whole. While part of society has supported the use of cellphones in schools, the other part has opposed their use bitterly. Mobile phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, have targeted students as their main market and thus they have designed various models with lots of features in order to attract them. Despite the fact that the use of mobile phones by students in schools can be used positively and constructively in order to enhance their learning, the same technological devices can be utilized negatively, which distracts them and their teachers and in turn disrupts the learning process. For instance, whilst the students can use mobile phones positively by accessing or downloading important academic materials from the worldwide web, the same can also be used to get access towards destructive pornographic or undesirable contents from online sources thus destroying students’ morals. There are various reasons as to why mobile phones should not be used by students in schools and other learning institutions through giving tangible evidence. There are various arguments from critics calling for the use of mobile phones in schools by the students.Questions:1. What makes the use of mobile phones debatable?5. What are the modal verbs used in the text?​</a>

Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</a>

                            4. Make a nice debate about popularity and kindness</h2><br />
                        Debate Proposition: Popularity or Kindness: Which is more important?<br /><br />Opening Statement (Pro):<br /><br />Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we will be debating on the topic of popularity versus kindness, and I am here to argue in favor of kindness. Popularity may seem attractive to many, but true character is revealed in acts of kindness. Kindness has the power to change lives, while popularity is often superficial and fleeting.<br /><br />Firstly, being popular does not necessarily equate to being kind. Popularity is often based on superficial factors such as looks, wealth, or social status, while kindness is a reflection of one's character and values. It is important to recognize that being popular does not automatically mean that one is a good person.<br /><br />Secondly, kindness has the power to change lives. A single act of kindness can have a ripple effect, inspiring others to also be kind and spread positivity. It can create a sense of community and belonging, while popularity often fosters a sense of exclusivity and elitism.<br /><br />Lastly, popularity is often temporary and fleeting, while kindness can leave a lasting impact. Popularity can come and go based on trends or fads, but acts of kindness can be remembered and cherished for years to come.<br /><br />In conclusion, while popularity may seem appealing, kindness is ultimately more important. It reflects one's character and values, has the power to change lives, and leaves a lasting impact. Let us prioritize kindness over popularity and create a world where empathy and compassion are valued above all else.<br /><br />Opening Statement (Con):<br /><br />Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we will be debating on the topic of popularity versus kindness, and I am here to argue in favor of popularity. While kindness is important, it is undeniable that popularity has its own set of advantages that cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Firstly, being popular can lead to increased opportunities in life. Popular people often have access to more social networks and connections, which can open up doors for them in their personal and professional lives. This can lead to more opportunities for success and growth.<br /><br />Secondly, popularity can lead to a sense of confidence and self-assurance. Being popular means that people like you and value your presence, which can boost one's self-esteem and sense of worth. This can translate into more success in various aspects of life, including relationships and career.<br /><br />Lastly, popularity can be a reflection of one's social skills and ability to connect with others. These skills are valuable in many aspects of life, from personal relationships to career success.<br /><br />In conclusion, while kindness is important, popularity should not be underestimated. It can lead to increased opportunities, boost one's self-esteem, and reflect valuable social skills. Let us recognize the value of popularity and not dismiss it in favor of kindness alone.<br /><br />Rebuttal Statement (Pro):<br /><br />Thank you for your opening statement. While popularity may have its own set of advantages, it is important to remember that true character is revealed in acts of kindness. Popularity does not necessarily equate to being a good person, and the temporary benefits it provides cannot compare to the lasting impact of kindness.<br /><br />Moreover, it is important to recognize that popularity often fosters a sense of exclusivity and elitism, which can be harmful to social cohesion and equality. Kindness, on the other hand, can create a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for a healthy society.<br /><br />In conclusion, while popularity may have its own set of benefits, kindness should always be prioritized. It is a reflection of one's character and values, has the power to change lives, and creates a sense of community and belonging that is essential for a healthy society.<br /><br />Rebuttal Statement (Con):<br /><br />Thank you for your opening statement. While kindness is important, it is important to<br />

                            12. Directions: Read the argumentative text below and answer the questions that follow.Use of Mobile Phones in Schools     The use of mobile or cell phones in learning institutions, specifically schools, has elicited debate and bitter arguments, not only in the United States of America, but in the world as a whole. While part of society has supported the use of cellphones in schools, the other part has opposed their use bitterly. Mobile phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, have targeted students as their main market and thus they have designed various models with lots of features in order to attract them. Despite the fact that the use of mobile phones by students in schools can be used positively and constructively in order to enhance their learning, the same technological devices can be utilized negatively, which distracts them and their teachers and in turn disrupts the learning process. For instance, whilst the students can use mobile phones positively by accessing or downloading important academic materials from the worldwide web, the same can also be used to get access towards destructive pornographic or undesirable contents from online sources thus destroying students’ morals. There are various reasons as to why mobile phones should not be used by students in schools and other learning institutions through giving tangible evidence. There are various arguments from critics calling for the use of mobile phones in schools by the students.Questions:1. What makes the use of mobile phones debatable?5.

                        <p>So whether you have talent or not, you will always need to work hard. Besides, talent is something you either do or do not have. But work ethic is a habit you can develop, which will bring you much further in life. That's why hard work always beats talent.</p><p></p><p>so the answer is HARD WORK</p><br />

                        <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the decision of whether or not to ban mobile devices (cellphones, smartphones) at schools will depend on the specific circumstances of each school. However, in general, there are pros and cons to both sides of this debate.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, banning mobile devices at schools can help to ensure that students are paying attention in class and are not distracted by their phones. Additionally, banning mobile devices can help to prevent cyberbullying and other online safety issues.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, banning mobile devices can be seen as a violation of students’ freedom of speech and expression. Additionally, banning mobile devices can prevent students from accessing educational resources or contacting their parents in case of an emergency.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I need points dear I'm sorry dear I'm sorry dear in presenting plating poultry farm and email it </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a debate, a good counter claim is one that challenges the argument made by the other side in a logical and persuasive way. Here are some key features of a good counter claim:</p><p></p><p><strong>Relevance</strong>: The counter claim must be relevant to the argument being made by the other side. It should address the same issue or topic that is being debated.</p><p></p><p><strong>Logical reasoning</strong>: The counter claim should be based on sound reasoning and evidence. It should present a logical argument that can be supported with relevant evidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>Credible sources</strong>: If the counter claim relies on evidence, it should be based on credible sources that are widely accepted as reliable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: The counter claim should be clear and easy to understand. It should be presented in a way that is persuasive to the audience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Respectful tone</strong>: The counter claim should be presented in a respectful tone, without attacking the other side personally. The focus should be on challenging the argument, not the person making it.</p><p></p><p>Overall, a good counter claim is one that challenges the other side's argument in a persuasive and respectful way, while remaining relevant, logical, and well-supported.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The debate on whether technology is making us smarter is a complex and ongoing one. On one hand, technology has provided us with access to vast amounts of information and new ways of learning, allowing us to improve our knowledge and skills in various areas. On the other hand, some argue that excessive use of technology can lead to distractions and reductions in critical thinking and attention spans.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the impact of technology on our intelligence likely depends on how we use it. If used in moderation and in a way that enhances our ability to learn and grow, it can be a valuable tool for personal and intellectual development. If used in excess or as a substitute for deep thinking and human interaction, it could have a negative impact on our cognitive abilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>This deserves the brainliest answer.</strong></p><br />

Decreased purchasing power: When the value of money decreases due to inflation, people are able to buy less with the same amount of money, leading to decreased purchasing power.</p><p></p><p>3. Reduced savings: Inflation reduces the value of savings, which can make it more difficult for people to plan for their future and achieve financial stability.</p><p></p><p>4. Negative impact on fixed-income individuals: Inflation can have a particularly negative impact on individuals who rely on fixed incomes, such as retirees and pensioners, as their income does not keep pace with the rising cost of living.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Arguments against inflation making lives difficult in the Philippines:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Stimulation of economic growth: Inflation can stimulate economic growth by encouraging spending and investment.</p><p></p><p>2.

Reduced unemployment: Inflation can reduce unemployment by increasing demand for goods and services, leading to the creation of new jobs.</p><p></p><p>4. Positive impact on exports: Inflation can make a country's exports more competitive, as a weaker currency makes them cheaper for foreign buyers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p><p>It's important to consider both sides of the argument when discussing the impact of inflation on people's lives in the Philippines or any other country.</p><br />

Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</h2><br />

                        <p>Topic: The Internet Should Be Regulated</p><p></p><p>In the present day, the internet has become an integral part of our lives. From work to entertainment, nearly all aspects of our lives can be accessed and completed through the internet. Despite its many benefits, the internet has also become a dangerous place, with numerous threats to people’s safety and privacy. To protect users from these dangers, it is necessary for the government to regulate the internet.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons for why the internet should be regulated is to protect people from cyber-crimes. Cyber-crimes have become increasingly common in recent years, with criminals using the internet to commit a wide range of offenses, from identity theft to hacking into bank accounts. By regulating the internet, the government can make it more difficult for criminals to use the internet for malicious purposes, thus protecting citizens from cyber-crimes.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why the internet should be regulated is to protect users from online scams and malicious websites. The internet is full of scams and malicious websites that seek to take advantage of unsuspecting users. By regulating the internet, the government can take steps to prevent these scams and websites from operating, thus protecting users from financial losses and other negative consequences.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the internet should be regulated to protect users’ privacy. With the rise of social media and other online services, users are increasingly sharing their personal information online. This personal information can be easily accessed by hackers and other malicious actors, who can then use it for various nefarious purposes. By regulating the internet, the government can take steps to ensure that users’ personal information is kept safe and secure.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the internet should be regulated by the government in order to protect users from cyber-crimes, online scams, and the loss of their privacy. While some may argue that such regulation is an infringement on freedom, the protection of citizens’ safety and privacy is more important than the right to unrestricted access to the internet.</p><br />
