                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Why do we behave ethically? Just think what life would be like if everyone did what they wanted, without regard for consequences.
</p><p>
</p><p>Much of my time is devoted to traveling around the country and giving speeches about ethics. Because this topic is of fundamental importance across all social groups, I’m hired to address people in business, education, health care, law, and the government. At the end of every talk, I ask the group, “Why should we be ethical?” Over the years, I’ve heard a wide range of responses, including:
</p><p>
</p><p>• To sleep better at night.
</p><p>
</p><p>• To be able to look myself in the mirror.
</p><p>
</p><p>• To be a good role model to my children.
</p><p>
</p><p>• It’s the easiest way to live.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Without ethics, life would be pure chaos.
</p><p>
</p><p>• It’s the right thing to do.
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the most creative answers came a few weeks ago when I was speaking to a group of human-resources managers in Cleveland: We’re all going to live forever. The question is where!
</p><p>
</p><p>The answers people give are thoughtful, sincere, and often inspirational.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then on the other hand, there’s the e-mail I get.
</p><p>
</p><p>As soon as my column appears, I’m always besieged by nasty letters, some of which are nothing more than personal attacks. It’s one thing to take issue with an argument. It’s quite another to insult the person making the argument. Of course, in taking on the role of public adviser, one needs to have (or to develop) a thick skin. What is striking to me about these hateful e-mails is the underlying assumption in most of them that ethics is a ridiculous topic, and that only a fool would take ethics seriously.
</p><p>
</p><p>In response to this chorus of naysayers, I propose the following Code of Ethics for the 21st century:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. The most important thing in life is to get exactly what you want, whenever you want, and by any means necessary. Thus, you have the absolute right to do whatever you have to do to satisfy whatever desire, craving, or wish you have.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Tell the truth at all times, unless it’s to your advantage to lie, deceive, or tell a partial truth.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Never take responsibility for anything. That way, you never have to worry that you may have done the wrong thing. Blame the misfortunes of the world, and in your own life, on the poor judgment of other people.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Keep your promises, unless something better comes along.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Kindness is for wimps. Let your true feelings show, no matter how unpleasant they may be.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Show care and compassion for your fellow human beings, unless they’ve hurt you. In that case, all bets are off.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. Have little or no regard for how your actions affect other people. It’s their problem, not yours, if they’re offended or harmed by what you say or do.
</p><p>
</p><p>8. Never, ever cheat, unless you can get away with it.
</p><p>
</p><p>9. Do not, under any circumstance, report wrongdoings you observe. Don’t get involved. It’s none of your business.
</p><p>
</p><p>10. Always follow the New Golden Rule: “Do unto others before they do unto you.”
</p><p>
</p><p>For those who criticize the subject of this column, this code might seem like the perfect antidote: Think about yourself, and only about yourself, and you will be fine.
</p><p>
</p><p>But how long could anyone live this way? What would the world look like if everyone followed these rules?

The audience’s perception of you as a speaker is influential in determining whether or not they will choose to accept your proposition. Aristotle called this element of the speech ethos, “a Greek word that is closely related to our terms ethical and ethnic.”[1] He taught speakers to establish credibility with the audience by appearing to have good moral character, common sense, and concern for the audience’s well-being.[2] Campbell &amp; Huxman explain that ethos is not about conveying that you, as an individual, are a good person. It is about “mirror[ing] the characteristics idealized by [the] culture or group” (ethnic),[3] and demonstrating that you make good moral choices with regard to your relationship within the group (ethics).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whether or not a university should offer a course on ethical hacking would depend on a variety of factors. Some potential considerations could include the following:</p><p></p><p>The demand for the course: In order to justify offering a course on ethical hacking, there should be a demonstrated demand for the course among students, employers, or other stakeholders. This could be assessed through surveys, focus groups, or other methods of gathering feedback from potential students and other interested parties.</p><p></p><p>The relevance of the course: The course on ethical hacking should be relevant to the university's mission and academic programs, and should align with the needs and interests of the university community. For example, if the university has a strong focus on computer science or information technology, a course on ethical hacking could be a valuable addition to the curriculum.</p><p></p><p>The qualifications of the instructor: In order to ensure the quality and credibility of the course, it is essential that the instructor has the appropriate expertise and experience in the field of ethical hacking. This could include relevant academic qualifications, professional certifications, and practical experience in the field.</p><p></p><p>The potential risks and liabilities: While ethical hacking can be a valuable skill, it can also be a complex and potentially risky field. Therefore, it is important for the university to carefully consider the potential risks and liabilities associated with offering a course on ethical hacking, and to put in place appropriate measures to mitigate these risks. This could include ensuring that the course is delivered in a secure and controlled environment, and that students are provided with adequate guidance and support.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, whether or not a university should offer a course on ethical hacking would depend on a variety of factors, including the demand for the course, the relevance of the course, the qualifications of the instructor, and the potential risks and liabilities.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        If you were to create another “commandment” regarding computer ethics,what would it be?<strong>commandment </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong>Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.Simply put: Do not use the computer in ways that may harm other people.<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong> This commandment says that it is unethical to use a computer to harm another user. It is not limited to physical injury. It includes harming or corrupting other users' data or files. The commandment states that it is wrong to use a computer to steal someone's personal information.</p><p></p><strong>commandment </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong>Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.Simply put: Do not use computer technology to cause interference in other users' work.<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong>Computer software can be used in ways that disturb other users or disrupt their work. Viruses, for example, are programs meant to harm useful computer programs or interfere with the normal functioning of a computer. Malicious software can disrupt the functioning of computers in more ways than one.</p><p></p><strong>commandment </strong><strong>3</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong>Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.Simply put: Do not spy on another person's computer data.<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong>We know it is wrong to read someone's personal letters. On the same lines, it is wrong to read someone else's email messages or files. Obtaining data from another person's private files is nothing less than breaking into someone's room. Snooping around in another person's files or reading someone else's personal messages is the invasion of his privacy. There are exceptions to this.</p><p>________________________________</p>Why do you think people should follow it?<p>Because,It can help prevent and detect cybercrime, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and terrorism. However, over bearing monitoring policies often result in censorship and the suppression of unpopular ideas. The Internet should and possibly will always remain decentralized without being regulated by the U.N.</p><p></p>Carry On LearningYan Pala lahat sagot ko PoSana Makatulong Yan Po lahat²<br />

                            27. Who is considered the father of modern ethics?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Immanuel Kant</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The German philosopher <strong>Immanuel Kant </strong>is the founder of deontological ethics. His ethics, which he mainly put forth in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and Metaphysics of Morals (1797), is one of the most prominent and highly respected theories in modernity.</p><br />

                            28. how would you apply ethics to change the way people see and understand things​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We should be kind, compassionate, respectful, and so on toward others. In other regards, an ethical leader practices incorporating their moral principles and personal qualities into their daily decisions. The morally upright qualities that shape our ethical nature are known as virtues. Virtue is founded on integrity</p><p><strong>How would you apply ethics to change the way people see and understand things​?</strong></p><p>Here are some ways you can apply ethics to your life:<br /></p><p>1. Consider how you interact with animals. Some folks may think animals don't ethically matter. <br />2. Be kinder to the environment. <br />3. Respect and defend human rights. <br />4. Become more ethical in your career. <br />5. Engage with medical advances.</p>Enhancing Well-Being<p>The principles help to distinguish right from wrong and act in accordance with The Golden Rule: <strong>Treat others the way you wish they would treat you.</strong> The Golden Rule is the foundation of ethical behavior and incorporates actions such as honesty, kindness, empathy, personal responsibility, etc.</p><p>We ought to treat others with kindness, compassion, respect, and so on. In other words, an ethical person practices applying virtues, our character traits, in making everyday decisions. Virtues are the positive traits of character that inform our ethical being. Integrity is the bedrock of virtue.</p><p><strong>Making ethical decisions based upon mutual respect and appropriate culturally-relevant social norms.</strong> Recognizing one's responsibility to behave ethically. Identifying solutions for personal and social problems. Anticipating and evaluating the consequences of one's actions.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps &lt;3</p><br />

                            30. . If you were to create another “commandment” regarding computer ethics,
what would it be? Why do you think people should follow it?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The commandments were introduced in the paper "In Pursuit of a 'Ten Commandments' for Computer Ethics" by Ramon C. Barquin as a means to create "a set of standards to guide and instruct people in the ethical use of computers." They follow the Internet Advisory Board's memo on ethics from 1987.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>^^</p><br />
