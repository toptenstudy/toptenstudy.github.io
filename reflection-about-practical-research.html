                                            A common assumption about higher education is that the institution has a complete grasp of its students' profiles and their learning and service preferences (Oblinger, Barone &amp; Hawkins, 2001, p.3), and those enerational differences between millennials and previous generations are generally understoo In the last few years, many have written and documented the essence and evolution of this generation; however, studies covering depth and breadth in understanding the millennial generation in different contexts such as education, workplace, and other settings are still in their infancy.One of the few studies that have investigated this generational cohort in the context of higher education is Paschal's (2003) dissertation on the expectations of generation Y students enrolled in nursing education. In this qualitative study, Paschal (2003) conducted interviews to better understand what these students' expectations were regarding nursing educators, learning environment, nursing school experience, and future opportunities a nursing education should offer.The eldest segment of millennials is already attending and making their presence known in colleges anduniversities around the nation. Parallel to this generational evolution, online learning has reached maturity.with great success and satisfaction especially for students from previous generations for whom the Internetwas a new technology. Millennials, however, have grown up with the Internet and therefore, expect a moresophisticated access.Consequently, researchers and practitioners facilitating online learning should reflect upon the implications for how current models and techniques will have to be adjusted for those students. Employers, too, will need to adjust their practices as these millennials graduate from college and enter the workforce​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quantitative research deals with numbers and statistics, while qualitative research deals with words and meanings. Quantitative methods allow you to systematically measure variables and test hypotheses. Qualitative methods allow you to explore concepts and experiences in more detail.Quantitative research generates factual, reliable outcome data that are usually generalizable to some larger populations, and qualitative research produces rich, detailed and valid process data based on the participant's, rather than the investigator's, perspectives and interpretations (1).</p><br />

                            19. A common assumption about higher education is that the institution has a complete grasp of its students' profiles and their learning and service preferences (Oblinger, Barone &amp; Hawkins, 2001, p.3), and those enerational differences between millennials and previous generations are generally understoo In the last few years, many have written and documented the essence and evolution of this generation; however, studies covering depth and breadth in understanding the millennial generation in different contexts such as education, workplace, and other settings are still in their infancy.One of the few studies that have investigated this generational cohort in the context of higher education is Paschal's (2003) dissertation on the expectations of generation Y students enrolled in nursing education. In this qualitative study, Paschal (2003) conducted interviews to better understand what these students' expectations were regarding nursing educators, learning environment, nursing school experience, and future opportunities a nursing education should offer.The eldest segment of millennials is already attending and making their presence known in colleges anduniversities around the nation. Parallel to this generational evolution, online learning has reached maturity.with great success and satisfaction especially for students from previous generations for whom the Internetwas a new technology. Millennials, however, have grown up with the Internet and therefore, expect a moresophisticated access.Consequently, researchers and practitioners facilitating online learning should reflect upon the implications for how current models and techniques will have to be adjusted for those students. Employers, too, will need to adjust their practices as these millennials graduate from college and enter the workforce​</h2><br />
