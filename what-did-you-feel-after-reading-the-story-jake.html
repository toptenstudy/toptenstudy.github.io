                            1. what did you feel after reading the story of jake​</h2><br />
                        <p>The story of Jake is incredibly saddening.  It is about a dog named Jake whose owner and best friend died because of sickness.  Jake was in a state of terrible loneliness ever since his best friend, Max, passed away.  I felt Jake’s pain and sorrow about losing the very person that he trusts and loves.  It must be really grievous for him to realize that he is never going to see him ever again, and to do all of the things that they used to do together.
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, the ending of the story was quite surprising.  It was not the ending that I was expecting which was more emotional and beautiful indeed.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>At first, I was confused about who was dead but as I read the story, I finally realize that it was Max and not Jake. It was sad how Jake felt sad and empty when Max passed away. On how he would recall his memories about him. It was a great story because of the friendship between Max and Jake. They prove that a Man and a Dog can be best friends.</p><p></p><p>I hope my answer helped you :&gt;</p><p></p><br />

                            7. What is Jake story all about?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Chapter 1
</p><p>Though young, Jake Muller is a seasoned mercenary, grinding out a living fighting for the rebels in Edonia. Life in the eastern European state suddenly changes with the arrival of a strange medicine, billed as nutritional supplements. Surprisingly, all who take the supplements begin to change; losing all human rational, they transform into monsters. Jake alone is left unaffected.
</p><p>Already confused by the chaos erupting at the base, the sudden appearance of U.S. agent Sherry Birkin only further confounds the young mercenary. Sherry explains that the so-called "supplement" is, in fact, the C-Virus: a horrible new mutation-inducing virus developed by the terrorist group Neo-Umbrella.  </p><p>Jake however, as Sherry explains, apparently carries antibodies; this fact quite possibly makes him the last and only hope for humanity in fighting the virus, and is the reason Sherry needs his assistance. True to his mercenary nature, however, Jake insists that if he really is the key to saving the world, his help will come at a cost; an agreement of fifty million dollars for his services is met, and the two go to make their escape from the embattled camp.
</p><p>At that same moment, Neo-Umbrella unleashes a monstrous hunter, known as Ustanak, to pursue the two.  </p><p>Amidst the ensuing deadly game of cat-and-mouse, the pair run into Chris Redfield of the BSAA—Chris being the older brother of Claire, to whom Sherry owes her life. With Chris' help, the two manage to escape the scene via a BSAA helicopter. However, Ustanak's relentless pursuit continues. In the creature's attempt to capture Jake, the helicopter sustains massive damage and begins to crash. Sherry and Jake manage to bail out, however, as they near the ground, a piece of the helicopter tears through their parachute, causing them to fall.

                        <p>1. I felt the pain and sorrow of the story, but was undeniably surprised of the ending.  The ending made me feel more grievous because it is not the plot that I expected which is remarkable indeed.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Jake was the dog of Max and Martha.  He was in a state of loneliness because Max, his best friend, died and he longs for Max’s presence.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. These are the words or phrases that helped me figure out Jake’s identity:
</p><p>…kneel down onto the carpet beside him.
</p><p>…tucks back his long, floppy ears…
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Max was Jake’s best friend and owner, and Martha’s partner, I suppose.  He died because of sickness.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. I believe that a dog is a man’s best friend because our pet dog feels the way we feel even if it cannot vocally express itself.  Its loyalty lies on its owner and just like what the story had narrated, a dog goes with us everywhere.  </p><p></p><p>Read the link for more discussion about this topic:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9681019</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        What is the theme of the story in jake by Jim bartlett?<p>Personalized Narrative Theme</p><p>Because the whole book concentrates around the character's real-world experience or a third-person narration of his work as a police officer, I'd classify it as a personalized narrative theme. It depicts how Jim, the protagonist, conducts his everyday life, thoughts, preparations, and activities while he commutes to work. As stated in the text, he was touched by his encounter with these current concerns in our society. Moreover, the present world events have given me empathy, or the ability to understand and share his feelings. These kinds of things still happen today, and in some cases, they're getting worse.</p><p></p>What is the point of view of the story in jake by jim bartlett?<p>The point-of-view used in the flash fiction is Third Person View, because it uses the pronouns of He, She, They, and narrates the character's life.</p><p></p>What is the introduction of the story in jake by jim bartlett?<p>Jim, the character's preparation for work as a policeman.</p><p></p>What is the ending of the story in jake by jim bartlett?<p>​Jim, the main character who narrates in the flash fiction, ended the story with his thought about changing the world if he only have the vaccine of happiness.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>What is the theme of the story in jake by jim bartlett?</strong><strong>Personalized Narrative Theme</strong><p>Because the whole book concentrates around the character's real-world experience or a third-person narration of his work as a police officer, I'd classify it as a personalized narrative theme. It depicts how Jim, the protagonist, conducts his everyday life, thoughts, preparations, and activities while he commutes to work. As stated in the text, he was touched by his encounter with these current concerns in our society. Moreover, the present world events have given me empathy, or the ability to understand and share his feelings. These kinds of things still happen today, and in some cases, they're getting worse.</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>What is the point of view of the story in jake by jim bartlett?</strong><p>The point-of-view used in the flash fiction is Third Person View, because it uses the pronouns of He, She, They, and narrates the character's life.</p><p></p><strong>What is the introduction of the story in jake by jim bartlett?</strong><p>Jim, the character's preparation for work as a policeman.</p><p></p><strong>What is the ending of the story in jake by jim bartlett?</strong><p>​Jim, the main character who narrates in the flash fiction, ended the story with his thought about changing the world if he only have the vaccine of happinness. </p><br />
