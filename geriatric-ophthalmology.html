Why Sunglasses Are a Must-Have for Kids (An Excerpt) Most parents know how damaging the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can be to our skin, which is why they dutifully slather sunscreen on their kids during the summer. But one thing that often gets overlooked is protecting their children's eyes. According to vision-care experts, kids receive three times more UV exposure than adults annually, yet less than 30 percent of parents currently protect their children's eyes with sunglasses. The reason for concern is that children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the sun's rays because their ocular lenses are not mature enough to filter UV light as effectively as adults, causing damage to the retina.             "Everyone buys into what happens to your skin when it comes to sun damage, but many parents are really surprised to learn about the cumulative UV damage to the eyes," Dawn Hartman, an optometrist at Columbus Ophthalmology Associates in Columbus, Ohio, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview. But the right sunglasses can help, as parents become more aware that protection from the sun is not just skin deep.​</a>

Why Sunglasses Are a Must-Have for Kids (An Excerpt) Most parents know how damaging the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can be to our skin, which is why they dutifully slather sunscreen on their kids during the summer. But one thing that often gets overlooked is protecting their children's eyes. According to vision-care experts, kids receive three times more UV exposure than adults annually, yet less than 30 percent of parents currently protect their children's eyes with sunglasses. The reason for concern is that children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the sun's rays because their ocular lenses are not mature enough to filter UV light as effectively as adults, causing damage to the retina.             "Everyone buys into what happens to your skin when it comes to sun damage, but many parents are really surprised to learn about the cumulative UV damage to the eyes," Dawn Hartman, an optometrist at Columbus Ophthalmology Associates in Columbus, Ohio, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview. But the right sunglasses can help, as parents become more aware that protection from the sun is not just skin deep.​</h2><br />
