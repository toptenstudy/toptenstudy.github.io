                                            THE MENTAL EFFECT OF CYBER BULLYING TO STUDENTS  Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.CAUSES OF BULLYING There’s no one reason why people bully, but many people who engage in this conduct:Feel powerlessSuffer from insecurityNeed to control othersEnjoy the rewards they get from bullyingFor example, bullying a classmate might make a kid more popular, or bullying a worker might stop other employees from questioning management decisions. These outcomes show bullies that this conduct pays off.Bullying is often a learned behavior. Young bullies might live in households where adults bully one another to get their way or deal with conflict. They might not know how else to get their needs met or how to manage disagreements.Some bullies have had temper tantrums to get their way since they were small children and were never told "no." Others were once bullied themselves and repeated the behavior to feel powerful. Some supervisors bully their subordinates to deflect attention away from their incompetence. Other bullies believe their status entitles them to bully individuals of lower rank. These bullies might also lack empathy, have narcissistic traits, or be emotionally unstable and dysregulated. Controlling and intimidating others helps them to feel better about themselves and self-soothe.Pagkakaintindi mo dito mahabang explain po defence​</a>

                        <p><strong>1. What is your philosophy in Life? </strong>(Are you sure it's 80 paragraphs?)</p><p></p><p>My greatest philosophical belief in life is that we should treat anybody, with deepest respect and love. We're not born to create hatred. We are born for us to interact and correlate with other human beings, to give joy and inspiration, and to be a source of peace and hope to anyone who needs it. A life full of gratitude is a life worth-living. When you plant something that is negative, it will bear a negative result. Instead of delving into fights and arguments, learn to lower your pride and accept that you sometimes are not perfect and forgive someone you consider as an enemy. Loving your enemies is better than hating them. You will just get stressed about it. </p><p></p><p>Just be contented about your life, treat others the way you want to be treated and you will live a happy life. </p><p></p><p><strong>2. What is digital identity?</strong></p><p></p><p>A digital identity is your identity online. It involves all activities you make.</p><p>Examples are your browsing history, passwords, usernames, social media accounts, birth date, online purchases, the sites you visit regularly, the connections you make, download history and many more.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. What is digital self?</strong></p><p></p><p>A digital self is none other than yourself, but in an online platform. It is yourself on the internet. It is about how you portray yourself and how you interact with others, on the internet. For example, the profiles you make are your digital selves. Your Instagram account is your digital self.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyRify</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Philosophy in Life <p></p>-Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other.<p></p>Digital IdentityF a c e book AccountG o o g l e AccountM e s s e n g e r AccountE m a i l AccountG - m a i l AccountI n s t a g r a m AccountY o u t u b e AccountP l a y S t o r e AccountD i s c o r d AccountB r a i n l y Account<p></p>What is your digital self?explain<p></p>-My digital self is my Personality in the Media.

                            11. THE MENTAL EFFECT OF CYBER BULLYING TO STUDENTS  Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.CAUSES OF BULLYING There’s no one reason why people bully, but many people who engage in this conduct:Feel powerlessSuffer from insecurityNeed to control othersEnjoy the rewards they get from bullyingFor example, bullying a classmate might make a kid more popular, or bullying a worker might stop other employees from questioning management decisions. These outcomes show bullies that this conduct pays off.Bullying is often a learned behavior. Young bullies might live in households where adults bully one another to get their way or deal with conflict. They might not know how else to get their needs met or how to manage disagreements.Some bullies have had temper tantrums to get their way since they were small children and were never told "no." Others were once bullied themselves and repeated the behavior to feel powerful. Some supervisors bully their subordinates to deflect attention away from their incompetence. Other bullies believe their status entitles them to bully individuals of lower rank. These bullies might also lack empathy, have narcissistic traits, or be emotionally unstable and dysregulated. Controlling and intimidating others helps them to feel better about themselves and self-soothe.Pagkakaintindi mo dito mahabang explain po defence​</h2><br />
