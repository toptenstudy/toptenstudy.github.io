The So Called "New Normal" Written by: Aileen P. Valverde It was a bright Sunday morning at the beach. I am at the shore happily enjoying myself with the cool breeze of the wind that touches my face and the calmness brought about by the waves kept ringing on my ears. It was such a lovely scene just looking at the vastness of the deep, blue sea. It soothes my weary soul for I have been through a lot for the past few weeks. Being at the beach is always a welcome experience for me. It brings back my strength and vitality that I will need when I get back to the city. That's why from time to time; I want to pamper myself with a treat at the beach. As I was about to dive at the crystal water, someone knocked hardly on my door, it was Mother waking me up for I have a virtual meeting with my principal at exactly 8:00. I really thought that it was real, but being in this so called "new normal" it would still be far from reality! 1. When did the story happen? 2. Where did it happen? 3. Who do you think is narrating in the story? 4. Why do you think the author love to go to the beach? 5. What are the things that made her feel happy going to the beach?​</a>

(10 points)My biggest "sana"  is that, I hope the selected student to my research paper will learn and value my work as like them a student's .This particularly help them to enhance there knowledged and may help them to control their time to manage all work that must be done. Although most of the student that I selected know what is time management in all particular basis, but as me a working student who have a lot work to finish will really appreciated the time management in order to passed and get finish on time.Therefore, I don't not say that only working student will just appreciate  and value this research paper, hence those student who have a responsibilities to their families will learn also. As if you can hear the words "time management" is very easy to figure out, but there's a lot of teenager having difficulty to their mental health specially those people having anxiety, trauma, and depression will having trouble to control there time and self. My point is that, in this research i hope the students will learn from this.​</a>

It was such a lovely scene just looking at the vastness of the deep, blue sea. It soothes my weary soul for I have been through a lot for the past few weeks. Being at the beach is always a welcome experience for me. It brings back my strength and vitality that I will need when I get back to the city. That's why from time to time; I want to pamper myself with a treat at the beach. As I was about to dive at the crystal water, someone knocked hardly on my door, it was Mother waking me up for I have a virtual meeting with my principal at exactly 8:00. I really thought that it was real, but being in this so called "new normal" it would still be far from reality! 1. When did the story happen? 2. Where did it happen? 3.

I also gained knowledge about the planets, food, and vegetation. And I've learnt a ton about both nature and the nations I genuinely adore. But it's different. My habit of rushing,opening my gadget, getting up early to complete my modules,was like making you healthier throughout the break. You are fr-ee to nap whenever you choose. Deadlines and timetables won't cause you worry. I'm happy that our professors allowed us a break from schoolwork since I can't really convey how much I appreciated the holiday.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Estuaries</strong> and their surrounding wetlands are bodies of water usually found where rivers meet the sea. Estuaries are home to unique plant and animal communities that have adapted to brackish water—a mixture of fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater.A <strong>food chain</strong> is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another. In a food chain, each organism occupies a different trophic level, defined by how many energy transfers separate it from the basic input of the chain.A <strong>food web</strong> is a diagram of feeding relationships that includes multiple intersecting food chains. Energy is passed up the food chain from one trophic level to the next but a lot of it is lost along the way<br />

But i’m not sure, i have read about the examples of nausea, about Diabetes, head ache, vomiting. And i repeat, i feel like vomiting but i’m really not vomiting. 
Can you help me what this is?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you're feeling pain at the right side of your head, that maybe caused by migraine or tension headaches since you've been doing your school works (maybe without taking a break that's why).</p><p></p><p>And when you're feeling like vomiting but you're not. Then I guess you're feeling nauseous because you're eating sugary foods which doesn't suit the combinations inside your stomach. Also, when you're feeling sick, and lack of energy. That maybe the lack of nutrients and exercises. That's the reason why you're feeling like this.</p><p></p><p>So, I suggest you take a break. Drink a lot of water, and stop eating to much sugary products as it can't give you enough nutrients but rather illness. Also take an exercises and get enough amount of sleep so you're headaches or throbbing pain in your head will be gone. :)</p><p></p><p>Stay safe and healthy! &lt;3</p><p></p><br />

Although most of the student that I selected know what is time management in all particular basis, but as me a working student who have a lot work to finish will really appreciated the time management in order to passed and get finish on time.Therefore, I don't not say that only working student will just appreciate  and value this research paper, hence those student who have a responsibilities to their families will learn also. As if you can hear the words "time management" is very easy to figure out, but there's a lot of teenager having difficulty to their mental health specially those people having anxiety, trauma, and depression will having trouble to control there time and self.
