Find the horizontal and vertical components. 5. Find the horizontal and vertical components of a bus going to North of West. Use the protractor determine the angle. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Michael's direction relative to his starting point once he arrives at his third stop can be found using vector addition. We can first find the displacement vectors for each leg of his journey:</p><p></p><p>- First leg: 6 km east and 3 km south = (-6 km, -3 km)</p><p>- Second leg: 2 km west and 1 km south = (2 km, -1 km)</p><p>- Third leg: 7 km west and 5 km north = (7 km, 5 km)</p><p></p><p>To find Michael's net displacement, we can add these vectors together:</p><p></p><p>Net displacement = (-6 km + 2 km + 7 km, -3 km - 1 km + 5 km)</p><p>                 = (3 km, 1 km)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Michael's direction relative to his starting point is 3 km to the east and 1 km to the north.</p><p></p><p>2. To find the horizontal and vertical components of the wind, we can use trigonometry. Let the horizontal component be x and the vertical component be y. Then:</p><p></p><p>tan(24°) = y/x</p><p></p><p>We also know that the magnitude of the wind velocity is 10 m/s. Therefore:</p><p></p><p>x² + y² = 10²</p><p></p><p>Solving for x and y, we get:</p><p></p><p>x = 9.29 m/s (horizontal component)</p><p>y = 3.94 m/s (vertical component)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the horizontal component of the wind is 9.29 m/s to the west, and the vertical component is 3.94 m/s to the south.</p><p></p><p>3. The acceleration down the ramp can be found using trigonometry. The ramp makes an angle of 37° to the north of east, so the vertical component of the acceleration is:</p><p></p><p>a_y = 9.8 m/s² * sin(37°) ≈ 5.9 m/s²</p><p></p><p>The horizontal component of the acceleration is:</p><p></p><p>a_x = 9.8 m/s² * cos(37°) ≈ 7.8 m/s²</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the acceleration down the ramp has a horizontal component of 7.8 m/s² to the east and a vertical component of 5.9 m/s² to the south.</p><p></p><p>4. The horizontal and vertical components of the boat's acceleration can be found using trigonometry. The boat's acceleration makes an angle of 25° south of east, so the horizontal component of the acceleration is:</p><p></p><p>a_x = 10 m/s * cos(25°) ≈ 9.16 m/s²</p><p></p><p>The vertical component of the acceleration is:</p><p></p><p>a_y = -10 m/s * sin(25°) ≈ -4.23 m/s²</p><p></p><p>Note that the vertical component is negative because the acceleration is directed downwards, which is opposite to the positive direction of the y-axis.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the boat's acceleration has a horizontal component of 9.16 m/s² to the east and a vertical component of -4.23 m/s² (or 4.23 m/s² downwards).</p><p></p><p>5. To find the horizontal and vertical components of the bus's velocity, we need to know the angle it is traveling relative to due west. Let the angle be θ. Then:</p><p></p><p>tan(θ) = (vertical component of velocity) / (horizontal component of velocity)</p><p></p><p>We also know that the bus is traveling to the north of west, so its angle relative to due west is:</p><p></p><p>θ = 90° - angle of travel to north = 90° - (angle given by protractor)</p><p></p><p>Once we know θ, we can use the above equation to find the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity. For example, if the angle given by the protractor is 30°, then</p><br />

                        Question<p>1. What is the process by which water is separated by heating?</p><p></p>Answer<p>⇒ Distillation</p><p></p><p>Distillation, process involving the conversion of a liquid into vapour that is subsequently condensed back to liquid form. This basic operation requires the use of a still or retort in which a liquid is heated, a condenser to cool the vapour, and a receiver to collect the distillate.</p><p></p>Question<p>2. Which of the following mixture can be separated by decantation? </p><p></p>Answer<p>⇒ Oil and Vinegar</p><p>A common example is decantation of oil and vinegar. When a mixture of the two liquids is allowed to settle, the oil will float on top of the water so the two components may be separated. Kerosene and water can also be separated using decantation.</p><p></p>Question<p>3. To separate rock into different sized particles for road building and other construction project, which technique is applicable? </p><p></p>Answer<p>⇒ SIFTING</p><p></p><p>Sifting is used to separate smaller solid particles from larger solid particles.</p><p>For example, the mixture of different sized solid particles can be put into a container that has a screen material at the bottom with holes of a certain size.</p><p></p>Question<p>4. What is the best technique in separating mixture of metals from other junk?</p><p></p>Answer<p>⇒ Aided by <strong>Magnets</strong></p><p></p><p>Iron, nickel, cobalt and gadolinium are naturally ferromagnetic elements. Common usage of the term "magnetic" refers to this form of magnetism. Other elements are capable of forming magnetic compounds, but are not magnetic in their pure states.</p><p></p>Question<p>5. It is done by passing a suspension through a filter paper retains the solid components of the mixture?</p><p></p>Answer<p>⇒ Filtration</p><p>Filtration is a method for separating an insoluble solid from a liquid. When a mixture of sand and water is filtered: the sand stays behind in the filter paper (it becomes the residue ) the water passes through the filter paper (it becomes the filtrate )</p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE IT HELPED</strong></p><p><strong>#CARRY ON LEARNING</strong></p><br />
