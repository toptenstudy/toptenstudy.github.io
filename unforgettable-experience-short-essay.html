                            6. Write a short paragraph about a specific unforgettable experience you have encountered during this pandemic ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 has impacted millions of Americans who have been out of work for weeks, thus creating a financial burden. Without a job and the certainty of knowing when one will return to work, paying rent and utilities has been a problem for many. With unemployment on the rise, relying on unemployment benefits has become a necessity for millions of people. According to the Washington Post, unemployment rose to 14.7% in April which is considered to be the worst since the Great Depression. </p><p></p><p>Those who are not worried about the financial aspect or the thought never crossed their minds have privilege. Merriam Webster defines privilege as “a right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage, or favor.” Privilege can have a negative connotation. What you choose to do with your privilege is what matters. Talking about privilege can bring discomfort, but the discomfort it brings can also carry the benefit of drawing awareness to one’s privilege, which can lead the person to take steps to help others. </p><p></p><p>I am a first-generation college student who recently transferred to a four-year university. When schools began to close, and students had to leave their on-campus housing, many lost their jobs.I was able to stay on campus because I live in an apartment. I am fortunate to still have a job, although the hours are minimal. My parents help pay for school expenses, including housing, tuition, and food. I do not have to worry about paying rent or how to pay for food because my parents are financially stable to help me. However, there are millions of college students who are not financially stable or do not have the support system I have. Here, I have the privilege and, thus, I am the one who can offer help to others. I may not have millions in funding, but volunteering for centers who need help is where I am able to help. Those who live in California can volunteer through Californians For All or at food banks, shelter facilities, making calls to seniors, etc. </p><p></p><p>I was not aware of my privilege during these times until I started reading more articles about how millions of people cannot afford to pay their rent, and landlords are starting to send notices of violations. Rather than feel guilty and be passive about it, I chose to put my privilege into a sense of purpose: Donating to nonprofits helping those affected by COVID-19, continuing to support local businesses, and supporting businesses who are donating profits to those affected by COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa follow narin ty</p><br />

                        A Short Essay About One of my Most Unforgettable Experiences<p>          There was that one time when I can never forget the surge of feelings I felt that day, it was the day I was told by my mother that I will no longer finish my studies. She wanted me to stop studying to give way to my siblings because they couldn’t provide education for all of us and I was the eldest among them. It was too expensive for our family.</p><p>          At first, I was down, and at the same time, I felt that it was too unfair to me. I was crying for countless days. There was a problem, and so I tried to think of a good answer or solution to that. Suddenly I had an idea of why not work and try to provide for myself, and so I did. I worked for 4 years of a part-time job while at the same time trying to finish my studies so that when I work in the future, I can help my brothers and sisters finish theirs. Looking back, I think the method I chose was the best for that situation. </p><p>           I will not be where I am today if the method I chose was not the best for me. To those who are experiencing the same situation I went through, I hope they choose the best answer and actualize it. </p><p></p><p><strong>For More Information</strong></p><p>More Unforgettable Experiences and What Makes it Unforgettable:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22215681</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There have been many experiences in my life that I would consider unforgettable, but one in particular stands out as the most significant and impactful.</p><p></p><p>It was the summer before my senior year of high school, and I had the opportunity to participate in a study abroad program in a small town in France. I had always been interested in French language and culture, so I jumped at the chance to immerse myself in it for a few weeks.</p><p></p><p>From the moment I arrived, I was struck by how different everything was from what I was used to. The language, the food, the customs – everything was new and exciting. I was nervous about communicating with my host family, but they were incredibly welcoming and patient with my limited French skills.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of the program, I had the chance to explore the town and surrounding areas, attend language classes, and participate in cultural activities. But the most memorable experience of all was the weekend I spent with a group of local teenagers.</p><p></p><p>Through a mutual friend, I was invited to join a group of French teens on a camping trip in the mountains. I was nervous about spending the weekend with strangers, especially since my French was far from perfect, but I was also excited for the adventure.</p><p></p><p>As we hiked up the mountain, I struggled to keep up with the conversation and understand the jokes and cultural references. But the other teens were patient and inclusive, making an effort to include me and help me understand.</p><p></p><p>That night, as we sat around the campfire, I realized that I was experiencing something truly special. Here I was, in the middle of the French Alps, surrounded by new friends who had taken me in as one of their own. We talked and laughed and shared stories late into the night, and I knew that I would never forget this moment.</p><p></p><p>As the weekend came to a close and we said our goodbyes, I felt a sense of sadness that it was all ending. But I also knew that I had gained so much from this experience – not just a deeper understanding of French culture, but also a newfound appreciation for the power of human connection.</p><p></p><p>In the years since that summer, I have gone on to have many other incredible experiences, but none have quite matched the magic of that weekend in the mountains. It taught me that even when we feel out of place or uncomfortable, there is always the potential for connection and friendship – and that those moments of connection are the ones that stay with us for a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>It was a dark and a little bit cold night. One of my friends suggested that we go outside for star seeing. We started from the cabana we lived in with a touch in each one’s hand. At first we just wanted to go around and appreciated the beautiful sky decorated by many stars. But then we decided to go further in. All we thought about was walking and talking. We ignored the most important thing which is the big forest was beyond the cabana. It was unfortunate that we went into the forest and got lost.</p><p>IMG_20161208_061206.jpp</p><p>When we found we were lost, it was too late to find the original way back to the cabana. I grasped my friends hands firmly. The cold and strong wind blew against my face all the time. It whispers through the trees. What’s more, the fog became thick quickly. Terrible fear came to my mind and made me tremble out of my control. I was sacred to death. The only idea came into my brain was that it was the end of my life. It was impossible for me to get out of the forest. Even though my friends tried to convince me that nothing bad would happen to us and we were safe and sound. I still feared that we would come to a sticky end.</p><p>It was hard to find the way clear because of the dense fog. It made us lose the sense of direction totally. We didn’t know which step to follow next. Suddenly, it seemed that a man with a torch stood in front of us. At first, it frightened us stiff. We dared not to open oureyes until he came to pat on our shoulders and told us that if we got lost, he would help us to find the way. At this moment, I was relieved because I knew I wouldn’t stay in the forest all the time. This kind man led us to go out. It was him who ended up this terrible experience of getting lost.</p><p>It was really an unforgettable experience in my life. I wil</p><br />
