It is through these virtues that we can be good stewards of God and has a greater chance that we will be rewarded for the good deeds we made.43. When the pandemic started, and longer lockdowns were imposed in the country, a lot of unplanned pregnancies happened knowing that everybody is just at home during that time. With that, Covid 19- babies are increasing, which technically leads to increasing of population in general. Do you think that this is a good indicator and is beneficial towards our environment, and why? Choose the BEST option. *a. Yes, because more and more people will plant trees and engage to other environmental initiatives than ever before.b. No, because it is annoying to see a lot of people especially children playing outside, which results to noise pollution.c. Yes, because the more people, the more the merrier. That means, more people will help mitigate and combat the climate crisis today.d. No, because the increase of population would mean that there will be more carbon footprints, and more people will share the limited amount of resources, thus making it worse for the environment as we try to look ways as to where to get and how to allocate these limited resources for everyone.44. “Environment is the reflection of our actions.” What does this statement imply? *1 pointa. The statement goes the same with this quote, “You are what you eat.”b. People will only take good action/s if they think the environment is in dire of help.c.

With this reality, is it justifiable to always use the environment extensively to serve our own self-interests? *a. No, but if it’s for the greatest happiness for the greater number of people, then it is total fine.b. Yes, because there is no way that we can survive in this co-dependent and co-existent world if we don’t rely with the resources available in our environment.c. Yes, because it is what it is and it’s part of the natural order of things where we humans must consume and make use of the resources anytime and anywhere, we want.d. No, it will never be justifiable because there are lots of sustainable ways to manage and utilize the resources without any further degradation and harming of the environment.​</a>

<p>
</p><p></p>Think about it before  buying it.  When it's <strong>expensive</strong>, then you'd better <strong>think twice </strong>whether  you really need the cloth or if you want it.  When buying new clothing, you should now consider how much money you consider, so even if you were going to know the <strong>price limits</strong> of the clothing you were going  to purchase, so you should still remember that you were going to buy the most expensive clothes, because at the end of the day you're not going to regret it.

<strong>Better decisions and of course realization
