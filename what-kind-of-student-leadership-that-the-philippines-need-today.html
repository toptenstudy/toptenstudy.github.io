A good leader with good and rightful goals and principles, a leader with knowledge and competitive spirit, and someone god-fearing. We also need a leader that will be able to understand, or at least try to understand us and a leader that will listen to one's voice and opinions. We also need a leader who's responsible enough, someone willing to lead and someone who will not neglect his/her duties during his/her term. Many leaders nowadays fails when it comes to not neglecting their duties. Many leaders also sugar-coat things. They will tell people beautiful things and in the end, it's all just for clout.</p><br />

                        <p>Hi Brainly User! </p><p></p><p>Make a 3 paraghraph argumentative essay about the kind of student leadership that the philippines</p><p></p><p> With the presidential election only one short month away, it’s important to know what makes a good leader. When choosing our president, not only should we look at their politics, but we should also look at their character. The certain qualities a person possesses can potentially determine what kind of leader they will be. I believe that a good leader possesses the qualities of dependability, integrity and perseverance. Without these qualities, I don’t see how any person can lead and direct a group, or in this case, a whole nation.</p><p></p><p>One of the single most important aspects of a good leader is dependability. To be a leader means you have a lot of responsibilities, so people have to depend on you to take care these responsibilities. Sometimes, being a leader comes with hard decisions, but it’s your responsibility to make those decisions. If people can depend on you to get them through not only the good times, but the hard ones too, then you have the making of a great leader.</p><p></p><p>Another important quality of being a great leader is integrity. The possession of firm principals ensures that you will make the most responsible decisions and do what you truly think is best. Having integrity means a person is honest, trustworthy, reliable, loyal and honorable. To be a leader you must possess these certain characteristics so that you are able to lead fairly and justly. Without integrity and a good set of core values, how can we be able to trust our leaders. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>"What kind of student leadership does the Philippines need today?"</p><p></p><p>           It is not necessary for a person to have a position to recognize him as a leader. "Many still do not understand, they think leadership has to do with position, level, rank, but as long as you have something to influence, someone is listening to you, you are doing something that has affected the lives of others, you are the leader of that.</p><p></p><p>           Being a good leader can be used for good or for bad because leadership is a tool. A good leader needs to have four C's such as competence, communication skills, consistency, and character. Competence refers to a person’s ability in his or her field. For example, a father may be considered the leader of his household. Communication skills, on the other hand, refer to a person's ability to share his or her ideas. "For example, you have competence, you have an idea, you can't say it. It's frustrating for you, but it's more frustrating for those who don't understand you, It is also important for a person to be consistent in order to be considered a good leader. "The one you read. Not today, you have a bad hair day. Tomorrow, no hair day. Is that today you are happy, tomorrow you will have an impact ...Your work is consistent, your words are consistent That has authenticity, there is transparency, " It is also said that a person's character can be seen if he is a good leader. "You can define whether it is okay to be a leader or not to be a good leader. So you become a good leader because you have emotional management discipline. The machine is easy, it is consistent. But the people has many variables.</p><p></p><p>          Being a leader is only developing. Do not be afraid or discouraged because every person has the ability to be a great leader. Everyone has the ability to be a leader, only to be brave, smart, courageous, self-confident, able to listen to others, socialize, and above all responsible for everything.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>HONESTY – A good president advocates truth and integrity. He conserves the trust and confidence given to him by the people. And of course, he doesn’t steal the funds of the nation. If you know someone who has a record of corruption, if proven guilty then cross him out immediately. Remember honesty is still the best policy.</p><p>ACTION – A good leader is a role model of hard work. He walks his talk and inspires his people through his actions. He is not purely talk, he makes sure that his promises are done and won’t be broken. Well, do you know someone who just take actions? Action still speaks louder than words. Just because he/she can talk well on stage doesn’t mean he/she can perform things in order. Look what he/she’s done while seated in the government.</p><p>PASSION – An effective head do their job with enthusiasm. They serve the public, not because of the money and fame they’ll receive, but because that is their mission in life. They’re born to be a leader. Vote for a leader who loves the country, not the money.</p><p>RESPECT – An effective president of a country respects the constitution, abides the laws, and honors the decision of the Supreme Court. He also listen and respect the opinions of the common people. Because this is a democratic country, it will count if he/she welcomes ideas from others.</p><p>CONFIDENCE – A great leader of a nation possesses self-confidence. If leaders won’t believe in themselves, no one else will. A true leader has the confidence to stand alone and the strength to make tough decisions.</p><p>INDEPENDENCE – A tough president is not a puppet. His actions are not a product of incomplete decisions. He is not manipulated by corrupt people who are thirsty of power and wealth of the nation. Usually he/she hates the corrupts.</p><p>COMMITMENT – An effective leader of the government is resolute in realizing his great visions and dreams for the country. Is he clear with his/her visions and plans for the country? Patience and persistence is visible in him.</p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY – An effective leader understands that he is the head of the state. He won’t blame his subordinates, instead, acknowledges his responsibility during hard times. He recognizes himself as the father of the entire nation and take responsibility in helping every Filipinos whenever they face problems. Do you know someone who play the blame-game? Cross him out! </p><p>HUMILITY – A great leader acknowledges his mistakes and weaknesses. He also admits that he’s not good at everything and that he needs everyone’s help. That is why he disseminates other crucial tasks to the other branches of the government, such as legislative and judiciary bodies. Can you pinpoint who commends himself all the time and says how good he/she is in everything? Run away! that’s not what we are looking for!</p><p>LOVE – Lastly, an effective president of the Philippines has a selfless love for his people and country. All of these qualities are difficult to practice, but because of his love, he’ll do his best to practice them all. I remember all Filipino heroes in the past are very expressive for their of the country. Take Jose Rizal’s writing where his love for the country is expressed immensely, he put his life to serve the country:“One only dies once, and if one does not die well, a good opportunity is lost and will not present itself again.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>i hope it helps a little bit</p><p> </p><p></p><br />
