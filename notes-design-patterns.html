                                            V. Here are steps in making patterns: Write numbers 1-7._______Draw a sketch of the product you want to make._______Cut the pattern pieces according to the actual size and shape of the linen._______Take note of the design of the cloth before laying the pattern flat on the table. Consider also the lengthwisegrain of the fabric which is the grain lines._______measure and mark the needed allowance by means of a gauge for ease in measuring and marking. Cut thefabric on the lines for allowance._______When laid on the pattern paper, trace with a tracing chalk or a pencil, just so you get the actual shape and sizeof the product you like to make. Use pins to prevent the cloth from moving while tracing._______For mass production, the pattern pieces which are named templates can be used._______Scale the design of the product on the pattern paper with the correct size and shape.​</a>

Write the numbers on the lines before each step. || Lay down fabric fiat on the table and position the different pattern pieces. You must take note of the grain line or design of the cloth. Sew pieces together to form the shape or design wanted. Start with a sketch, drawing, or a photographic image of a linen product or clothing scaled into the desired size you want. Pin the pattern on the cloth and start tracing. Using correct measurements, scale the sketch or drawing on the pat-term paper. The linens and curves determine how the article or clothing is broken down into sections. Cut the patterns paper to achieve the actual shape and size of the different parts of the product. We call these pattern pieces templates that can be used in mass production. Pattern can be modified on the original template to achieve the necessary size you want. You can make it smaller or bigger by just decreasing or increasing the scale. Mark the needed allowances for sewing. Cut the fabric on the lines for allowance.100 point​</a>

Here are steps in making patterns: Write numbers 1-7._______Draw a sketch of the product you want to make._______Cut the pattern pieces according to the actual size and shape of the linen._______Take note of the design of the cloth before laying the pattern flat on the table. Consider also the lengthwisegrain of the fabric which is the grain lines._______measure and mark the needed allowance by means of a gauge for ease in measuring and marking. Cut thefabric on the lines for allowance._______When laid on the pattern paper, trace with a tracing chalk or a pencil, just so you get the actual shape and sizeof the product you like to make. Use pins to prevent the cloth from moving while tracing._______For mass production, the pattern pieces which are named templates can be used._______Scale the design of the product on the pattern paper with the correct size and shape.​</h2><br />

Write the numbers on the lines before each step. || Lay down fabric fiat on the table and position the different pattern pieces. You must take note of the grain line or design of the cloth. Sew pieces together to form the shape or design wanted. Start with a sketch, drawing, or a photographic image of a linen product or clothing scaled into the desired size you want. Pin the pattern on the cloth and start tracing. Using correct measurements, scale the sketch or drawing on the pat-term paper. The linens and curves determine how the article or clothing is broken down into sections. Cut the patterns paper to achieve the actual shape and size of the different parts of the product. We call these pattern pieces templates that can be used in mass production. Pattern can be modified on the original template to achieve the necessary size you want. You can make it smaller or bigger by just decreasing or increasing the scale. Mark the needed allowances for sewing. Cut the fabric on the lines for allowance.100 point​</h2><br />
