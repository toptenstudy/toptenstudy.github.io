Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>History of Art Final Paper I think the most important part of art Is understanding how styles developed over the years and what Influenced those developments. Some art movements develop based on political context, while others are created as a contrast to the current popular art movement. From a historical standpoint, I feel that portraiture is the best way to capture the essence of everything throughout the past. If I were an art director, I would choose to a portraiture display to show the progression of styles through time.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Since my exhibition has to do with historical context, I would arrange my pieces In very strict chronological order. The dates of the paintings themselves would not have to be in chronological order, but the order in which the different art styles came about would have to be followed exactly. My exhibit would start off with The Mona Lisa, by Leonardo dad Vinci. This was painted c. 1503-1519 during the High Renaissance in Italy. It is considered to be one of the most popular and well-recognized examples of portraiture In the world, so It would only seem logical to Include it in the exalt.</p><p></p><p>The High Renaissances mall focus was returning to classical antiquity, such as the beauty of the art from ancient mimes and a rebirth of the classical culture. This spawning of new intellectual ideas came after the Middle Ages in Europe, which were generally considered a very dark time. The Renaissance evoked in people nostalgia for the culture of the classical ages. A focus of the Renaissance was the growing interest in humanism, as opposed to strictly religious works.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Arts in the Philippines refer to all the various forms of the arts that have developed and accumulated in the Philippines from the beginning of civilization in the country up to the present era. They reflect the range of artistic influences on the country's culture, including indigenous forms of the arts, and how these influences have honed the country's arts. These arts are divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts[1] and non-traditional arts.[2] Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories.</p><br />

In your observation, has there been any instance or non- inclusive behavior that need to be corrected? Write 200-word essay on your insights. Cite examples.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In recent years, there have been several instances of non-inclusive behavior that need to be corrected. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment, with some people blaming the Chinese people for the spread of the virus. This has resulted in racist name-calling, discrimination, and even physical attacks against people of Chinese descent. This behavior is not only unjustified but also unhelpful in tackling the pandemic, as it divides people and undermines efforts to work together to find solutions.</p><p></p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement also highlights the need for greater inclusivity and respect for diversity. The movement sparked in response to the killing of African-Americans by members of the police, and draws attention to the systemic racism and discrimination that many people of color face. This movement has led to calls for greater police accountability, social justice, and equal rights for all people, regardless of their race or ethnicity.</p><p></p><p>In my observation, I have also noticed instances of non-inclusive behavior in my own community. For example, I have seen people make insensitive jokes or comments about individuals with disabilities or mental health conditions. I have also witnessed people making assumptions or stereotyping others based on their gender, religion, or sexual orientation.</p><p></p><p>To correct these non-inclusive behaviors, it is important to promote greater awareness and understanding of diversity and inclusion. This can be done through education, community outreach programs, and initiatives that promote tolerance and respect for different cultures and perspectives. It is also important to hold individuals and organizations accountable for any discriminatory behavior or practices, and to provide support and resources to those who have been affected by such behavior.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, non-inclusive behavior remains a persistent problem in many communities. It is important to recognize and address these issues, and to work towards a more inclusive and respectful society. By promoting diversity and inclusion, we can create a more harmonious and equitable world for all people.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Kindly hit the thanks button.</p><p></p><br />
