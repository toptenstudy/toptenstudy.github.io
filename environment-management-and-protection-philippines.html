                                            ibuod ang kwento ng Currently on Leyte Island, the Philippines, reforestation and protection of natural forests is difficult, which in part can be attributed to the livelihoods of some people causing a damaging impact on the natural forests (Emtage 2004a). Additionally, the Philippines is one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia (Cramb 2000). People on Leyte Island tend to have their livelihoods focused around food security and cash income (Lasco and Pulhin 1999). This lack of opportunities and reliance on the land has resulted in damage to the natural resources of the Philippines. Devastation to the natural resources can be alleviated through rural development. Tree farming for smallholder farmers1 is perceived as being a viable land use for promoting rural development and improving the socio-economic situation of resource-poor people. However, the rate of tree planting by smallholders is low, for a variety of reasons, including lack of resources and concern over government regulations. The Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has developed policies to encourage tree planting (Calub 2005). Tree farming in the Philippines has the potential to expand, due in part to encouragement from the DENR. A survey conducted by Emtage (2004b) found that about 60% of people surveyed in four rural communities on Leyte Island expressed an interest in commercial tree growing. However, only a small proportion of landholders undertake tree farming. This paper reports findings of case studies about the way in which tree farmers in Maasin Community Environment and Natural Resource (CENR) district in Southern Leyte Province in the Philippines2 are managing their tree farms. This will provide input in reviews of policies and practices of DENR to encourage tree planting. The impact that DENR has on the way smallholders manage their tree farms, and the reason for their choice to grow trees, is discussed.​</a>

Defending the country in some criminals, terrorism and other who try steal our territory and they Give us the peace, justice and harmony, they trains us how to respect by obeying them when they are in our front nor in the back. Responsible for Guard in any areas for sure there is no accident or any cases. Equipment’s is not a problem in AFP because they are providing much of it, so that this country can fight for sought justice. Supported by the government is a big help to maintain the ground forces because we don’t know when or where is having a war. Over the years, the AFP Reserve Force has been an important component to the defense force and therefore the whole country delivering essential contributions to defense, development and security. Members of the reserve force are highly valued for his or her role in safeguarding the safety of the state, for his or her assistance in socio-economic development, their support in rescue and relief during calamities and disasters, their functions and services in times of emergencies, and to help within the operation and maintenance of essential government or private utilities within the furtherance of its overall mission.

The Philippine army is to be knowledgeable capable and responsive army that's a source of national pride. to arrange such units as maybe necessary for the effective implementation of national defense plans and programs and soldiers missions To train, organize and equip all Army reserve units for the possible expansion of the peacetime Army component to satisfy any emergency; and To perform such functions because the upper authorities may direct. Considered collectively of the foremost battle-hardened, professional armies within the globe due to their long exposure to left-wing Communist insurgency, various Muslim separatist groups, various extreme right-wing groups and various international campaigns in support of democracy. The AFP also engage in nonmilitary activities, like providing disaster relief, constructing civilian housing, and participating in literacy campaigns. Its foundation day is well-known every December 21st. The National Defense College of the Philippines (NDC) and Philippine academy (PMA) are the principal defense training institutions. A nation enjoying and sustaining its natural resources and a clean and healthy environment. To mobilize our citizenry in protecting, conserving, and managing the environment and natural resources for the present and future generations. government should seriously enhance the AFP is material and technical capabilities. and eventually, the restoration of unit cohesiveness and therefore the culture of excellence within the AFP must be made a priority if the organization is to stay effective.</a>

                            8. ibuod ang kwento ng Currently on Leyte Island, the Philippines, reforestation and protection of natural forests is difficult, which in part can be attributed to the livelihoods of some people causing a damaging impact on the natural forests (Emtage 2004a). Additionally, the Philippines is one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia (Cramb 2000). People on Leyte Island tend to have their livelihoods focused around food security and cash income (Lasco and Pulhin 1999). This lack of opportunities and reliance on the land has resulted in damage to the natural resources of the Philippines. Devastation to the natural resources can be alleviated through rural development. Tree farming for smallholder farmers1 is perceived as being a viable land use for promoting rural development and improving the socio-economic situation of resource-poor people. However, the rate of tree planting by smallholders is low, for a variety of reasons, including lack of resources and concern over government regulations. The Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has developed policies to encourage tree planting (Calub 2005). Tree farming in the Philippines has the potential to expand, due in part to encouragement from the DENR. A survey conducted by Emtage (2004b) found that about 60% of people surveyed in four rural communities on Leyte Island expressed an interest in commercial tree growing. However, only a small proportion of landholders undertake tree farming. This paper reports findings of case studies about the way in which tree farmers in Maasin Community Environment and Natural Resource (CENR) district in Southern Leyte Province in the Philippines2 are managing their tree farms. This will provide input in reviews of policies and practices of DENR to encourage tree planting. The impact that DENR has on the way smallholders manage their tree farms, and the reason for their choice to grow trees, is discussed.​</h2><br />

                            16. In my own understanding, The Armed Forces of the Philippines is know as one of the highest rank in society. This duty is to maintain the peace of our country and to perform kindness for those who needs. Defending the country in some criminals, terrorism and other who try steal our territory and they Give us the peace, justice and harmony, they trains us how to respect by obeying them when they are in our front nor in the back. Responsible for Guard in any areas for sure there is no accident or any cases. Equipment’s is not a problem in AFP because they are providing much of it, so that this country can fight for sought justice. Supported by the government is a big help to maintain the ground forces because we don’t know when or where is having a war. Over the years, the AFP Reserve Force has been an important component to the defense force and therefore the whole country delivering essential contributions to defense, development and security. Members of the reserve force are highly valued for his or her role in safeguarding the safety of the state, for his or her assistance in socio-economic development, their support in rescue and relief during calamities and disasters, their functions and services in times of emergencies, and to help within the operation and maintenance of essential government or private utilities within the furtherance of its overall mission. Given this, the strategic role of the reserve force in nation building is basically contributory to assembling national resilience as force multipliers and economic, among others with an end visible to serve the simplest interest of the country. The Philippine army is to be knowledgeable capable and responsive army that's a source of national pride. to arrange such units as maybe necessary for the effective implementation of national defense plans and programs and soldiers missions To train, organize and equip all Army reserve units for the possible expansion of the peacetime Army component to satisfy any emergency; and To perform such functions because the upper authorities may direct. Considered collectively of the foremost battle-hardened, professional armies within the globe due to their long exposure to left-wing Communist insurgency, various Muslim separatist groups, various extreme right-wing groups and various international campaigns in support of democracy. The AFP also engage in nonmilitary activities, like providing disaster relief, constructing civilian housing, and participating in literacy campaigns.
