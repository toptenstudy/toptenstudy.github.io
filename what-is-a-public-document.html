Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2. Why did Megan Reyes choose Silliman University?3. What's her purpose for applying? 4. What other documents are sent together with her letter?​</a>

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration.
