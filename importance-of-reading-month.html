Instructions: Read the paragraph below. Identify the importance or benefits of plants propagation using scientific processes mentioned in the paragraph. Write the importance or benefits inside the oval. Write your answers in your notebook.
Jamimah and Afasy are siblings and they both love to plant. Since they are young, they started to plant trees. The family produces fresh fruits and supplies it to fruit vendors. For the past months, their sales are obviously decreasing because they do not have enough supply to meet the needs of their business. Afasy recall their lesson in T.L.E. 6 about using scientific processes in planting. Afasy and Jamimah suggested it to their parents. After months of hard work, they slowly observed that their plants grow strong and healthy. They also observed that their plants have less mortality. Because of that, they can produce more fruits and they can sell more. Upon harvesting the mangoes they can’t deny the fact that their fruit have good quality and the best kind compared to their last harvest. Their sales are noticeably increasing and gained more profit. Their fruit stand business is now doing well.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Malnutrition</strong> is a serious condition that happens when your diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients. It means <strong>"poor nutrition</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> </strong>and can refer to: undernutrition – not getting enough nutrients. overnutrition – getting more nutrients than needed.<strong>Stunting</strong> is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation.

Take a daily prenatal vitamin. Stay hydrated.Go to your prenatal care checkups. Avoid certain foods. Don't drink alcohol. Don't smoke. Get moving.Breast milk contains <strong>antibodies</strong> that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding lowers your baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Plus, babies who are breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, without any formula, have fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses, and bouts of diarrhea.<strong>Obesity</strong> is generally caused by <strong>eating too much and moving too little.</strong> If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but do not burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.Consume less “bad” fat and more “good” fat.Consume less processed and sugary foods.Eat more servings of vegetables and fruits.

Jamimah and Afasy are siblings and they both love to plant. Since they are young, they started to plant trees. The family produces fresh fruits and supplies it to fruit vendors. For the past months, their sales are obviously decreasing because they do not have enough supply to meet the needs of their business. Afasy recall their lesson in T.L.E. 6 about using scientific processes in planting. Afasy and Jamimah suggested it to their parents. After months of hard work, they slowly observed that their plants grow strong and healthy. They also observed that their plants have less mortality. Because of that, they can produce more fruits and they can sell more. Upon harvesting the mangoes they can’t deny the fact that their fruit have good quality and the best kind compared to their last harvest. Their sales are noticeably increasing and gained more profit. Their fruit stand business is now doing well.
