</p><p>2,000 salary increase per annum
</p><p>The question asks for the salary of the expert on the 12th year.
</p><p>Thus, we can use the formula
</p><p>Salary + (salary increase x number of years)
</p><p>Since salary increase annually is constant, we can multiply it first directly with the number of years.
</p><p>Substituting the given, we will now have
</p><p>360, 000 + (2, 000 x 11)
</p><p>We use 11 years because in the first year, the beginning salary is 360,000. The increase is effective in the second year.
