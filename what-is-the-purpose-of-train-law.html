                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                        Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion or TRAIN Law's purpose is to increase the taxes ,maybe to have funds for buildings and to increase the salary of the police or something that is important.<br /><br />The TRAIN (Tax reform for Acceleration and Inclusion) Law was basically ratified in hope of tax reformation. The law's mechanization is generally a concept of cutting income tax but on he other hand raises Excise Tax of luxuries and oil. <br /><br />Personally, I do consider this law as hindi maka masa, because the prices of gasoline and all other types of oil rises, all other products become more expensive, including our basic commodities.<br />

                            8. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."
