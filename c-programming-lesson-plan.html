1. Mang Jethro wants to know if pig A is a good meat converter. He decided to keep track of its feeding for a month. He weighed it before beginning the program. He discovered that its current weight is 25 kilograms. He fed it ad libitum for a month, resulting in 125 kilograms of feed consumption. The pig was weighed for the second time and came in at 45 kilograms. How much is its FCR? What does it imply?

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

1. Mang Jethro wants to know if pig A is a good meat converter. He decided to keep track of its feeding for a month. He weighed it before beginning the program. He discovered that its current weight is 25 kilograms. He fed it ad libitum for a month, resulting in 125 kilograms of feed consumption. The pig was weighed for the second time and came in at 45 kilograms. How much is its FCR? What does it imply?
2. Mang Jethro subjected another pig to the same program. The pig is 40 kilograms in weight. Feed consumption for a month is 200 kilos, and the animal has gained a total weight of 100 kilograms. How much is its FCR? What does it imply?
3. Which of the two hogs can give more meat? Why do you say so? What shall we do with the other one?
C. Mang Jerico has been raising 125 layers in his farm for the past 8 months. He observed that some of them began to climb the nest while others did not. He realized that the layers would lay their eggs at any time, so he planned to build their nest according to the recommended size mentioned in our lesson ( LG1 - nest ).
Questions:
1. How many nests should he build to accommodate these 125 layers?
2. What size should the nest be? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Mang Jethro wants to know if pig A is a good meat converter. He decided to keep track of its feeding for a month. He weighed it before beginning the program. He discovered that its current weight is 25 kilograms. He fed it ad libitum for a month, resulting in 125 kilograms of feed consumption. The pig was weighed for the second time and came in at 45 kilograms. What is its FCR? What does it imply?</strong></p><p><strong>-It’s FCR is 6.25, Because it’s initial weight is 25 then it was fed ad libitum for a month and that is 125 of the feed consumption the total weight gained at the end of the month was 45kg, To get the fcr you have to minus the initial weight and the final weight resulting in 20kg then divide the feed consumption which is 125kg so 125kg divided by 20 equals 6.25 is the FCR</strong></p><p><strong>2.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and defensible. Ideas that you are considering need to be carefully examined in choosing a topic, developing your argument, and organizing your paper.2. Consider the situation. ...Clarify your thinking. ...Construct a claim. ...Collect evidence. ...Consider key objections. ...Craft your argument. ...Confirm your main point.</h2><br />
