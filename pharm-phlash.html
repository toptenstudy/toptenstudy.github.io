Moreover, the message this novel conveys to myself, a senior in high school, is to question the higher authority (or those who are dominant). In addition, my position is stated in such a way because of the corrupt nature the pigs rule the farm. Furthermore, in support of my view, The Animal Farm (essentially) begins with the farm animals overthrowing their higher authority, the farmer. This is so that the animals could ease their stressful lives becoming more apt to a healthier environment and favorable working conditions. To add, the pigs, due to their high literacy and intelligence, become entitled to governing rule. This governing rule enforces changes that better the farm, however, overtime, self-concern (within the rule) causes its corruptness.  In addition, such corruption in rule is seen when Napoleon (the head of the Animal Farm and source of corruptness) removes others in rule, like Snowball who was in favor of benefiting the animal’s wellbeing. With Snowball and others removed, Napoleon forms rules and guidelines for the animals to follows so the pigs end up benefiting the most. With this, changes that Napoleon implements eventually harms the other animal’s welfare and causes the farm to essentially lose tact and organization. With all that in mind, the message this novel has given to me is to challenge higher authority when it is not acting in the best favor of myself and others around me. In this manner, the higher authority is then considerate and open-minded to the needs of its people it must meet.</p><p></p><p>                Upon the conclusion of The Animal Farm certain strengths and drawbacks can be taken from its reading.  To begin, strengths arise from the original notion of ridding the farm of its owner so that the animals can ease their workload as well as create a favorable environment to live in. Such an environment, as portrayed in the novel, shows its strengths in having all the animals work in equal unity, surpassing their obstacles, so that together they achieve feats never achieved before. An example, occurs when the animals build a windmill. As George Orwell’s text goes, “’All that year the animals worked,’ but they were happy in their work.’” (Orwell, 59) To add, the significance of this quote is that the animals (plural) worked on the windmill showing the novels strength in equal work and unity. However, there are drawbacks that appear post-rebellion (when the animals took over). Such drawbacks are the governing rule established by the pigs (the smartest of animals). The governing rule overtime imposed harsher working environments, at the cost of the animal’s welfare. In fact, these animals “worked like slaves” when it came to the windmill and production of food. (Orwell, 59) All of this this was in efforts to create marvelous statistics (partially falsified in content) that the pigs could essentially boast about to their human foes. In addition to the drawbacks, the original seven commandments were slowly stripped of their original meanings and intentions. For example, the seventh commandment originally read “All animals are equal.” (Orwell, 25) However, after some corruption the revised commandment read “All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.” (Orwell, 134) To conclude, The Animal Farm as a novel is able to achieve certain strengths and drawbacks in its plot through powerful events that affect all the characters in similar ways. </p><p></p><br />

                            7. What is the role of biotechnology in bio manufacturing and pharming?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Pharming” is a new branch of biotechnology where plants or animals are genetically engineered to produce pharmaceutical proteins. It is hoped that pharming may lead to new, better or cheaper drugs. However, questions remain with regard to the choice of plants or animals, environmental and pharmacological safety, the welfare of pharming animals, the legal regulation of pharming, societal concerns, and moral evaluation. To address these questions, the Europäische Akademie GmbH is conducting the interdisciplinary research project “Pharming. Genetically Modified Plants and Animals as Future Production Site of Pharmaceuticals?”. As part of the project, in order to highlight and discuss some specific aspects of pharming, a workshop was arranged in Berlin on 14th/15th September 2006. Some of the results from the workshop are made available in this volume of the “Graue Reihe”. The collection of papers reflects the interdisciplinary scope of our approach. After a general introduction to pharming, the following topics are addressed: the prospects of pharming in plants, challenges faced by companies that wish to introduce pharming products to the marketplace, ethical aspects of pharming, and legal considerations with regard to the welfare of pharming animals.</strong></p><p></p><br />
