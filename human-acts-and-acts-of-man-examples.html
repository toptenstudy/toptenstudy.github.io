Freedom and obligation, according to John Mothershead, are two necessary conditions for morality to exist. *2. Human actions are not always thought through intellectually. *3. Being accountable for your actions, decisions, and behavior is what responsibility entails. *4. Acts of Man are involuntary acts performed by man without his intellect or will being in command of them. *5. Mario's profuse sweating during and after a workout is an example of a human act. *6. Kassandra, 12th grader in Tanza National Comprehensive Highschool, is working on her performance tasks for the second grading is an example of human act. *7. Stress may cause a person's practical decision to coincide with his intellectual decision. *8. Practical choice usually pertains to choices for an actual moral dilemma. *9. Some philosophers believe that freedom is valuable in and of itself; that it is beneficial in and of itself. *10. You cannot have freedom if you refuse to accept responsibility. They either come together or go together. If you avoid responsibility, you must accept consequences in some form or another. *​</a>

                            7. Choose the word TRUE if the statement is correct and choose the word FALSE if the statement conveys otherwise. 1. Freedom and obligation, according to John Mothershead, are two necessary conditions for morality to exist. *2. Human actions are not always thought through intellectually. *3. Being accountable for your actions, decisions, and behavior is what responsibility entails. *4. Acts of Man are involuntary acts performed by man without his intellect or will being in command of them. *5. Mario's profuse sweating during and after a workout is an example of a human act. *6. Kassandra, 12th grader in Tanza National Comprehensive Highschool, is working on her performance tasks for the second grading is an example of human act. *7. Stress may cause a person's practical decision to coincide with his intellectual decision. *8. Practical choice usually pertains to choices for an actual moral dilemma. *9. Some philosophers believe that freedom is valuable in and of itself; that it is beneficial in and of itself. *10. You cannot have freedom if you refuse to accept responsibility.

                            28. There are 3 elements needed to make a man/woman responsible for his/her action .Explain these elements and their connectedness by way of giving an example that would illustrate the validity of the human act or being moral.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Making judgments about whether a person is morally responsible for her behavior, and holding others and ourselves responsible for actions and the consequences of actions, is a fundamental and familiar part of our moral practices and our interpersonal relationships.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The judgment that a person is morally responsible for her behavior involves—at least to a first approximation—attributing certain powers and capacities to that person, and viewing her behavior as arising (in the right way) from the fact that the person has, and has exercised, these powers and capacities. Whatever the correct account of the powers and capacities at issue (and canvassing different accounts is the task of this entry), their possession qualifies an agent as morally responsible in a general sense: that is, as one who may be morally responsible for particular exercises of agency. Normal adult human beings may possess the powers and capacities in question, and non-human animals, very young children, and those suffering from severe developmental disabilities or dementia (to give a few examples) are generally taken to lack them.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To hold someone responsible involves—again, to a first approximation—responding to that person in ways that are made appropriate by the judgment that she is morally responsible. These responses often constitute instances of moral praise or moral blame (though there may be reason to allow for morally responsible behavior that is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy: see McKenna 2012: 16–17 and M. Zimmerman 1988: 61–62). Blame is a response that may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for behavior that is wrong or bad, and praise is a response that may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for behavior that is right or good.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Human beings</strong> though scientifically are considered as belong to the animal Kingdom, are fundamentally different from them in at least two aspects. The first is the capacity to think of <strong>abstract ideas</strong> (intellect, abstract thinking). When most animals are driven by instincts, humans can be driven by both instinct and abstract concepts. Secondly, humans can use <strong>language</strong>. While animals also use some form of communication, the are not as complex as the one we use when communicating with other human beings. </p><p></p><p><strong>Answers to Question</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Which of the following if NOT the basis of human actions?</p><p><strong>Answer:  </strong>b.
