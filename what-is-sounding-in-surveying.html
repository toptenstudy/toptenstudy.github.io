10. Relies heavily on the skills of the researcher to understand and interpret what they are seeing
in an unbiased way.

                                            Learning Activity SheetP a g e | 3 Grade9a.Check for Consciousness1.Ask the victim: “Hey, hey, are you okay?” while carefully shaking the victim’s shoulder.2.When there is no response, not even mumbles or groans, the victim is unconscious and in need of immediate medical help.b.Open the Airway1.The victim’s unconsciousness maybe due to an obstruction in his/her airway. It may also be caused by a narrowed airway making breathing impossible.2.Find out if there is loss of muscular control in the throat area which allows the tongue to slip back and block the throat.3.Lift the chin and tilt the head of the victim (if the victim is an adult). This way you will be able to lift the tongue from the back of the throat, leaving the airway clear.c.Check for Breathing1.Put your face near the victim’s mouth and look, listen, and feel for breathing. You should observe for:Chest movement, sound of breathing, or feel of breath on your cheekd.Check for Circulation1.Locate pulse using your middle and index finger. Pulse indicates blood circulation, which is essential for the heart and brain to function.2.Poor blood circulation may be reflected on the pale color of the skin. This is fatal.3.To revive circulation, perform CPR immediately.2.Secondary SurveySecondary survey is used when the victim is conscious or has revived.It aims to detect everything about the patient’s condition.a.History TakingSAMPLE PAIN is the mnemonic in order to perform the steps more easily.S-ymptoms (the chief complaint of the patient)A-llergy (find out if the victim is allergic to anything)M-edication (what are the medicines s/he is currently taking) P- revious illness (that may be related to the problem)L-ast meal (only for those subject for operation)E-vents prior to what happenedP-eriod of pain (How long? What started it?)A-rea (Where is the pain coming from?)I-ntensityN-ullify (What stopped it?)b.Checking for Vital Signs A. Pulse rateSteps in checking the pulse:Use your fingertips in getting the pulse. Follow the following procedure:1.Place the finger tip over an artery where it either crosses a bone or lies close to the skin.2.Feel the pulsations as the pressure wave of blood causes the vessel wall to expand –that is the pulse.The pulse rate may be taken in different points in the body like:1.Brachial5. Subclavian2.Carotid6. Axillary3.Wrist 7. Femoral4.TemporalNO-NO in Getting Pulse RateNever use your thumb; it has its own pulse.Do not palpate both the c​</a>

Learning Activity SheetP a g e | 3 Grade9a.Check for Consciousness1.Ask the victim: “Hey, hey, are you okay?” while carefully shaking the victim’s shoulder.2.When there is no response, not even mumbles or groans, the victim is unconscious and in need of immediate medical help.b.Open the Airway1.The victim’s unconsciousness maybe due to an obstruction in his/her airway. It may also be caused by a narrowed airway making breathing impossible.2.Find out if there is loss of muscular control in the throat area which allows the tongue to slip back and block the throat.3.Lift the chin and tilt the head of the victim (if the victim is an adult). This way you will be able to lift the tongue from the back of the throat, leaving the airway clear.c.Check for Breathing1.Put your face near the victim’s mouth and look, listen, and feel for breathing. You should observe for:Chest movement, sound of breathing, or feel of breath on your cheekd.Check for Circulation1.Locate pulse using your middle and index finger. Pulse indicates blood circulation, which is essential for the heart and brain to function.2.Poor blood circulation may be reflected on the pale color of the skin. This is fatal.3.To revive circulation, perform CPR immediately.2.Secondary SurveySecondary survey is used when the victim is conscious or has revived.It aims to detect everything about the patient’s condition.a.History TakingSAMPLE PAIN is the mnemonic in order to perform the steps more easily.S-ymptoms (the chief complaint of the patient)A-llergy (find out if the victim is allergic to anything)M-edication (what are the medicines s/he is currently taking) P- revious illness (that may be related to the problem)L-ast meal (only for those subject for operation)E-vents prior to what happenedP-eriod of pain (How long? What started it?)A-rea (Where is the pain coming from?)I-ntensityN-ullify (What stopped it?)b.Checking for Vital Signs A. Pulse rateSteps in checking the pulse:Use your fingertips in getting the pulse. Follow the following procedure:1.Place the finger tip over an artery where it either crosses a bone or lies close to the skin.2.Feel the pulsations as the pressure wave of blood causes the vessel wall to expand –that is the pulse.The pulse rate may be taken in different points in the body like:1.Brachial5. Subclavian2.Carotid6. Axillary3.Wrist 7. Femoral4.TemporalNO-NO in Getting Pulse RateNever use your thumb; it has its own pulse.Do not palpate both the c​</h2><br />
