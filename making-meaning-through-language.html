THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE
In the human quest for understanding the natural world,
the ability to name and classify objects found in nature was seen
as a first step in knowing. Thus, the scientific search for truth
early on recognized the usefulness of language and the ability it
gave to make sense of nature. For the ancient Greeks, language
was an object worthy of admiration. Words have power.
This kind of knowing sprang from the Greek fascination
and wonder at the power of words and language. How is it
possible that one's idea can simultaneously exist in his/her mind
and in another's? How is it possible that human beings can
communicate through words and thus form a community? Does
the power of the communicated word come from the speaker,
who is the thinker and the source, or from the listener, who is
the recipient of the communication? However you answer these
points, it is clear that thinking in terms of a common system

To make it more inclusive, we changed "his" to "their." Additionally, "reach" was in a different tense than the other verbs listed, so we changed it to "reach" to match the others.</p><p>4.The original sentence used "biography" and "short story" in singular form, but used "contemporary dramas," "legends," "fables," "essays," "anecdotes," "news," and "speech" in plural form, which made the sentence unparallel.

To make it parallel, we changed "drama" to "dramatic," which is an adjective like the others.</p><br />

THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE
In the human quest for understanding the natural world,
the ability to name and classify objects found in nature was seen
as a first step in knowing. Thus, the scientific search for truth
early on recognized the usefulness of language and the ability it
gave to make sense of nature. For the ancient Greeks, language
was an object worthy of admiration. Words have power.
This kind of knowing sprang from the Greek fascination
and wonder at the power of words and language. How is it
possible that one's idea can simultaneously exist in his/her mind
and in another's? How is it possible that human beings can
communicate through words and thus form a community? Does
the power of the communicated word come from the speaker,
who is the thinker and the source, or from the listener, who is
the recipient of the communication? However you answer these
points, it is clear that thinking in terms of a common system
being generated by the speaker and received by the listener is
useful in the pursuit of knowledge. Science, from the Latin
word scire (meaning to know), is one kind of knowledge the
Greeks wanted to understand.
The idea of comprehending words as more than just
combinations of sounds led the Greeks to seek out the principles</h2><br />
