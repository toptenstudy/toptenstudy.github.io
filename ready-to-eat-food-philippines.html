A hurricane is a strong wind or it can also be called a large, <strong>very strong storm with eddies of winds with a speed of 120 km/hour or more</strong>. Tornadoes and hurricanes are both characterized by strong wind vortexes. However, hurricanes are much larger than tornadoes. The diameter of a hurricane can reach about 1,600 km, much larger than a tornado whose maximum diameter is only about 2.4 km. </p><p>A cyclone is the term for a mature tropical cyclone that forms between the 100th and 180th eastern meridians in the Earth's northern hemisphere. This area is known as the Northwest Pacific Basin, which is the most active tropical cyclone region on Earth, where almost one third of the world's annual tropical cyclones are formed in this region.Hurricanes are caused by pressure differences in a weather system with a minimum distance of 500 km from the equator. <strong>The strongest winds that occur in the tropics generally swirl with a radius of hundreds of kilometers around areas of </strong>extreme low pressure systems with velocities of about 20 km/h.  Typhoons are common when the seasons change from summer to autumn.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about typhoon</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/28177767</p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
