It is the strictest of all forms of quarantine used in the Philippines It has introduced us to a new mode of living where staying at home becomes essential to save lives. It has also limited our opportunities to work and socialize. Others even lose their jobs as industries have eventually closed. There came the SAP (Social Amelioration Program) or better known as "ayuda" from the National Government. Local government units impose curfew and other restrictions adhering the IATF safety and health protocols. Many government sectors and agencies were challenged, education at the most. Thus, a new set up in the educational system was introduced. All these and more are accounted to a life-threatening virus where staying at home becomes fundamental to life. 1.

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

Baguio City is said to be the "Summer Capital of the Philippines" due to itscool mountain weather. It is located high up in the mountains in the province ofBenguet, Luzon. Air at higher elevation is cooler because the pressure is low, that'swhy Baguio is really cold. This cold weather is what the tourists love about Baguio notto mention the beautiful captivating places. It was designated by the PhilippineCommission as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines" on June 1, 1903.2. Baguio City was first called “Kafagway" by the locals. The name Baguiooriginates from the American period and is derived from the Ibaloi word bagiw. Bagiwliterally is referring to a kind of moss which abounded in the area together with thetibangdan or the giant fern. Bagiw was then Hispanized as "Baguio".3.

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

Complete the table by writing thestatements that fall under fact, judgement and actionThe K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providingsufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, producelifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurshipand employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Southeast Asia</strong></p><p>The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia, on the eastern rim of the Asiatic Mediterranean.</p><p></p><p>2. The Philippines is <strong>located in the western Pacific Ocean,</strong> <strong>surrounded by naturally warm waters that will likely get even warmer</strong> as average sea-surface temperatures continue to rise.

Large bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and large lakes affect the climate of an area. <strong>Water heats and cools more slowly than land</strong>.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Values play a significant role in making a house into a home. They provide a sense of identity and belonging for the people who live there. A house that is infused with positive values creates a positive and nurturing environment for its inhabitants. On the other hand, a house that lacks values or has negative values can create a negative and toxic atmosphere. To make a house into a home, it is important to identify and cultivate values that align with one's personal beliefs and goals. These values should be reflected in the daily habits and routines of the people living in the home, as well as in the overall atmosphere and decor of the space.</p><p></p><p>2. Technology can change the way we communicate and interact with each other. It can also alter the way we access and share information. Some people may value convenience and efficiency over privacy.</p><p>Others may place a higher value on traditional ways of living. The impact of technology on values varies among individuals and societies.</p><p></p><p>3. Different children learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners, while others may be auditory learners. It is important to identify a child's learning style and tailor teaching methods accordingly. This can increase the child's engagement and understanding of the material. Failing to adapt to a child's learning style may result in frustration and decreased motivation.</p><p></p><p>4. Values can be influenced by family, culture, and life experiences. Early childhood experiences and role models can shape a person's values. Social interactions and group membership can also influence values. Personal goals and beliefs can also play a role in the development of values.</p><p>As a person grows and experiences new things, their values may change and evolve.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippine Value system has degraded over time because of the increased influence of Western culture, the rise of materialism, the weakening of family relations, the rise of individualism, and the erosion of traditional values and beliefs. The traditional values that were once passed down from generation to generation have been replaced by the modern values of consumerism, materialism, and selfishness. The newer generation has embraced the values of instant gratification, convenience, and pleasure-seeking, which has caused them to neglect the importance of community, family and faith. Additionally, the lack of proper education and guidance for young people has also been a factor in the degradation of the Philippine Value system. Finally, the increasing influence of the media and social media has caused many to lose touch with their Filipino identity, which has further weakened the traditional values and beliefs of the country.</p><br />

It is the strictest of all forms of quarantine used in the Philippines It has introduced us to a new mode of living where staying at home becomes essential to save lives. It has also limited our opportunities to work and socialize. Others even lose their jobs as industries have eventually closed. There came the SAP (Social Amelioration Program) or better known as "ayuda" from the National Government. Local government units impose curfew and other restrictions adhering the IATF safety and health protocols. Many government sectors and agencies were challenged, education at the most. Thus, a new set up in the educational system was introduced. All these and more are accounted to a life-threatening virus where staying at home becomes fundamental to life. 1.

                            7. Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                            18. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

This shouldalarm us all since MSMEs comprise 98.57 percent of all businessestablishments in the country. They account for 71 percent ofemployment and 25 percent of export earnings. Collectively, theycontribute 39 percent to GDP.3. The conflict in the West Philippine Sea has intensified as China hasincreasingly become more aggressive.
