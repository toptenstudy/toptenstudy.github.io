give the university an informed idea of the applicant's areas of research
interest in order to avail the necessary assistance for them to develop a full
research proposal and allocate supervisors to give the necessary assistance.</p><p> </p><p>Structure of the Concept Paper.</p><p>As a
guide and to encourage uniformity in assessment of the concept papers, all
applicants should structure their concept papers; taking into account the
preceding process guidelines; as follows:-</p><p>·        
Cover
page — include the
title of your research, your names as they appear in the academic documents,
the area of specialization of the PhD as advertised and months and date</p><p>·        
Introduction — Briefly tells us about the area of your
proposed interest and why such area is of significance to study. Justify why
such an area is of utmost importance to do research about ( not more than 3
paragraphs)</p><p>·        
Problem
statement — Briefly state
what the problem of the investigation will be for the proposed study. Give
evidence of the magnitude of the problem by either giving the statistics where
applicable or citations. Remember your problem can be theoretical or practical
and whichever you opt to address, make sure you have ‘convicted’ the problem
(two paragraphs)</p><p>·        
Research
Questions, Objectives and Hypotheses — Formulate the key questions which your study intends to explore.
The questions should be in harmony with the formulated objectives and any
hypotheses if any; given the natural relationships among the three. Not more
than 6 research questions/ objectives should be formulated</p><p>·        
Literature — Briefly review the current literature
about the proposed area of research. Use journal sources and primary sources
like dissertations within your area of specialization. At this level, you can
show how current you are aware of the debates and developments within your
chosen area of research ( 2-3 pages would be adequate)</p><p>·        
Methodology — Finally, you should briefly describe the
methodology you intend to follow in conducting the proposed research. You need
to show in this methodology the research orientation in terms of research
paradigm-qualitative, quantitative or both</p><p>



















</p><p>·        
References — The last part of your concept paper
should be a list of references (all works cited in the text) and ensure you
follow the American Psychological association style of referencing (APA). Its

The structure of the paper mainly depends on the journal to which author wants to submit. However, in all conceptual papers there has to be an introduction entailing the need for the paper, what is already written about the subject, and what this new paper adds to the literature. The remaining subsections are authors' discretion. Those conceptual papers in which the authors clearly state their methodology and the sources for argumentation could be based on extensive and systematic literature reviews. A general structure could be:</p><p>Introduction (Explaining the need of and international relevance of the paper and a few statements about the existing literature)</p><p>Background (A detailed discussion of the previous literature on the very subject)</p><p>Purpose/Aim</p><p>Major arguments along with the supporting literature</p><p>Discussion (Implications, future research, limitations)</p><p>Conclusion</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Title</strong>: The title is the first thing that readers will see, so it should be attention-grabbing and accurately reflect the essence of the proposed project or study. It should be concise yet informative, providing a clear indication of the content.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Introduction</strong>: The introduction should effectively engage the reader and provide a compelling overview of the proposed project or study. It should establish the context and significance of the topic, and create interest in the reader to continue reading further.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Problem Statement</strong>: The problem statement is a critical component of the concept paper as it identifies the issue or problem that the proposed project or study aims to address. It should be well-defined, specific, and supported by evidence to highlight the need for the project or study.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Objectives</strong>: The objectives should be clearly stated and aligned with the problem statement. They should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound), providing a clear roadmap of what the project or study aims to achieve.

                        Similarities and Differences Between the Two Structures or Formats of a Concept Paper for a Project and as a Concept Paper for Academic Research	<p></p><p><strong>Concept papers for projects and concept papers for academic research have a few important distinctions.</strong> First off, compared to a concept paper for academic research, a concept paper for a project is often shorter and more focused. This is to ensure that readers would understand that a concept paper for a project is intended to provide a concise summary of the project, whereas a concept paper for academic research is intended to provide a more thorough review of the research issue. Second, a concept paper for an academic study is normally prepared by a group of researchers, as opposed to a concept paper for a project, which is typically authored by the project manager or main researcher. A concept paper for a project, on the other hand, is often used to secure money for the project, whilst a concept paper for academic research, on the other hand, is typically used to secure funding for the research team.</p><p></p><p><strong>Both concept papers for projects and concept papers for academic research function as an initial proposal or overview of an idea.</strong> They are frequently employed to aid in the clarification of the planned project or study's aims and objectives, as well as the strategies and tactics that will be employed to meet those objectives. Both kinds of concept papers serve to give a broad overview of the proposed work and to pique readers' interest in and support for the project or study. Both kinds of concept papers frequently include details about the proposed work's history and context as well as any potential relevance of the outcomes.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, <strong>the length, focus, and author are the main distinctions</strong> between concept papers for projects and concept papers for academic research.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about concept paper, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5143408</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
