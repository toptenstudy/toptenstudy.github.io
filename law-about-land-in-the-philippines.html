Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

                                            History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</a>

                                            To our adjucators,member of the opposition team, classmates, good evening!! Let me discuss to our stand tonights motion. LIBRT: THE 1987 Philippine Constitution Should Be Amended. Let me specify tou you what amendments should be amend in this constitution. This only the Economic provision of 1987 constitutions, where written policy for the economy in the constitution is very limited, in the fact of that, the Organization of Economic Co-operation ang Development (OECD) statistics that we are 3rd and number 1 in Asociation of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) very restrictive constitutional constitution in the world. The fact that our Constitution is the fundemental law of our land, no question about that, but restriction and policy given by the constitution making hendraces to the economic provision of the country where we can amend this for the purpose of recovering the country from poverty. Republic Act 8762 Entitled The Retail Trade LiberalizationAct of 2000, as amended by Republic Act no. 11595, and Republic Act no. 7042 "Foreign Direct Investment Act of 1991" this both act given the policy of fourty percent (40%) of equity capital of the enterprise engaged therein. The act allows foreign investors to invest up to 100% equity in domestic market enterprises, but also sets restrictions. The goal of this law is to encourage foreign investors to provide employment opportunities, develop resources, increase the value of exports, and help fuel the overall economy. When the global crisis comes in 2019, the COVID19 pandemic, the employment rate of the country decrease, and the unemployment rate increase, business and establishments closed due to foreign investment restriction, bankcruptcy, that foreign investment might help the country boost the stability and open the doors of opportunity for those facing economic unstability.and make the country become more competitive to other country. In this purposed,amending the constitution help us people in the future to more productive,more competive and no citizen will be burried in poverty, and no one will be left behind,we will all rise with confidence. Therefore, the 1987 constitution should be amended!! Thank youMaka a opposite reply speech of this.3mins speech ​</a>

DUTERTE'SSTATE OF THE NATION ADDRESSMANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte used his 4th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22, to tell Congress whatlaws he wants passed and what Filipinos can expect in the last half of his term. It lasted an hour and 33 minutes, making it his 3rd longest SONAso far.

Some key points here:* Corruption - Duterte condemus the PhilHealth ghost kidney treatment scam, commends the National Bureau of Investigation for the arrest ofhigh-profile criminals, and recalls how he has fired "more than a hundred" government officials. He cites revenue collections by governmentcorporations as signs that anti-corruption reforms are working.* Anti-red tape - He tells the Land Transportation Office, Social Security System, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Land Registration Authority,and Pag-IBIG to improve their services as data from the complaint center under his office show they were the subject of many complaints.He wants processing of permits to last only 3 days.* Rehabilitation of tourist attractions - Duterte brings up the temporary closure of Boracay and the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. He threatensto "burn down" establishments that commit violations.* Telecommunications - Duterte speaks about Dito Telecommunity, the newly established third telecommunications provider in thePhilippines. He challenges them to render services to as many Filipinos as possible. He also promises no corruption was involved in DitoTelecommunity's entry into the sector. pahelp po pls.​</a>

Write your answer on your answer sheet. 1. President Duterte is the best President our country has ever had. He has cut down massively drugs use and jailed drug traffickers. He has thrown out of office a number of corrupt officials more than any president has done. Finally, He has responded with grace and strength to difficult crisis like the pandemic, disasters and calamities 2. China, being a superpower nation like the United States, has been asserting its dominance against other claimants like the Philippines over the disputed territories in the South China Sea. It refuses to follow the UN Convention of the Laws of the Seas. It has reclaimed large-scale land and other structures. It has also been involved in bullying fishermen over the territories 3. COVID-19, though it has killed millions of people all over the world, is not the deadliest disease ever experienced by humanity. In fact, Ebola kills upwards of 50% of people it infects. The coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) result in death in about 10% of infections and between 30% to 40% of cases, respectively 4. It's not a good idea to leave kids younger than 10 years old home alone. Every child is different, but at that age, most kids don't have the maturity and skills to respond to an emergency if they're alone. Furthermore, results of studies showed negative effects like conduct problems, hyperactivity/ inattention and peer relationship problems. Text No Arguments Connectives/ Conjunctions Used 1 2 3​</a>

Coronel’s essayunravels the “No Man’s Land where policing and criminality become indistinguishable” (168).

Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

                            6. History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</h2><br />

                            11. To our adjucators,member of the opposition team, classmates, good evening!! Let me discuss to our stand tonights motion. LIBRT: THE 1987 Philippine Constitution Should Be Amended. Let me specify tou you what amendments should be amend in this constitution. This only the Economic provision of 1987 constitutions, where written policy for the economy in the constitution is very limited, in the fact of that, the Organization of Economic Co-operation ang Development (OECD) statistics that we are 3rd and number 1 in Asociation of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) very restrictive constitutional constitution in the world. The fact that our Constitution is the fundemental law of our land, no question about that, but restriction and policy given by the constitution making hendraces to the economic provision of the country where we can amend this for the purpose of recovering the country from poverty. Republic Act 8762 Entitled The Retail Trade LiberalizationAct of 2000, as amended by Republic Act no. 11595, and Republic Act no. 7042 "Foreign Direct Investment Act of 1991" this both act given the policy of fourty percent (40%) of equity capital of the enterprise engaged therein. The act allows foreign investors to invest up to 100% equity in domestic market enterprises, but also sets restrictions. The goal of this law is to encourage foreign investors to provide employment opportunities, develop resources, increase the value of exports, and help fuel the overall economy. When the global crisis comes in 2019, the COVID19 pandemic, the employment rate of the country decrease, and the unemployment rate increase, business and establishments closed due to foreign investment restriction, bankcruptcy, that foreign investment might help the country boost the stability and open the doors of opportunity for those facing economic unstability.and make the country become more competitive to other country. In this purposed,amending the constitution help us people in the future to more productive,more competive and no citizen will be burried in poverty, and no one will be left behind,we will all rise with confidence. Therefore, the 1987 constitution should be amended!! Thank youMaka a opposite reply speech of this.3mins speech ​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>Good evening to everyone present here today. As the opposition team, we do not believe that the 1987 Philippine Constitution should be amended, specifically in terms of the economic provisions. We believe that the current restrictions in the constitution are necessary to protect the interests of the Filipino people and ensure that the benefits of economic development are shared equitably among all.</p><p></p><p>While it is true that the Philippines has a restrictive constitution compared to other countries, this has not prevented the country from achieving economic growth and development. In fact, the Philippines has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the region in recent years, despite the restrictions in the constitution.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we believe that the restrictions on foreign investment are necessary to prevent the exploitation of our natural resources and the displacement of local businesses by foreign corporations. Allowing 100% foreign ownership of local businesses could lead to the domination of our economy by foreign interests, which may not necessarily have the best interests of the Filipino people at heart.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we believe that the problem of poverty in the Philippines cannot be solved by relying solely on foreign investment. We need to address the root causes of poverty, such as inequality, lack of access to education and healthcare, and inadequate social services. Amending the constitution to allow more foreign investment may provide short-term benefits, but it will not address these underlying issues.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the 1987 Philippine Constitution should not be amended, and that the current restrictions on foreign investment are necessary to protect the interests of the Filipino people and ensure equitable economic development.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

DUTERTE'SSTATE OF THE NATION ADDRESSMANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte used his 4th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22, to tell Congress whatlaws he wants passed and what Filipinos can expect in the last half of his term. It lasted an hour and 33 minutes, making it his 3rd longest SONAso far.

He cites revenue collections by governmentcorporations as signs that anti-corruption reforms are working.* Anti-red tape - He tells the Land Transportation Office, Social Security System, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Land Registration Authority,and Pag-IBIG to improve their services as data from the complaint center under his office show they were the subject of many complaints.He wants processing of permits to last only 3 days.* Rehabilitation of tourist attractions - Duterte brings up the temporary closure of Boracay and the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. He threatensto "burn down" establishments that commit violations.* Telecommunications - Duterte speaks about Dito Telecommunity, the newly established third telecommunications provider in thePhilippines. He challenges them to render services to as many Filipinos as possible. He also promises no corruption was involved in DitoTelecommunity's entry into the sector. pahelp po pls.​</h2><br />

President Duterte is the best President our country has ever had. He has cut down massively drugs use and jailed drug traffickers. He has thrown out of office a number of corrupt officials more than any president has done. Finally, He has responded with grace and strength to difficult crisis like the pandemic, disasters and calamities 2. China, being a superpower nation like the United States, has been asserting its dominance against other claimants like the Philippines over the disputed territories in the South China Sea. It refuses to follow the UN Convention of the Laws of the Seas. It has reclaimed large-scale land and other structures. It has also been involved in bullying fishermen over the territories 3. COVID-19, though it has killed millions of people all over the world, is not the deadliest disease ever experienced by humanity. In fact, Ebola kills upwards of 50% of people it infects. The coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) result in death in about 10% of infections and between 30% to 40% of cases, respectively 4. It's not a good idea to leave kids younger than 10 years old home alone. Every child is different, but at that age, most kids don't have the maturity and skills to respond to an emergency if they're alone. Furthermore, results of studies showed negative effects like conduct problems, hyperactivity/ inattention and peer relationship problems.

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very . early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board as a and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

</p><p>questions that follow. Do this in your notebook
</p><p>"I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher
</p><p>in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler
</p><p>My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare
</p><p>rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and
</p><p>during my early youth, my father saved as much as he
</p><p>could from his meager salary and from what he could
</p><p>get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos
</p><p>with which to give me an education. During those
</p><p>Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small
</p><p>town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus,
</p><p>did my family live for years. When I was at the age of
</p><p>five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father
</p><p>and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary
</p><p>instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and
</p><p>began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived
</p><p>in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one
</p><p>priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved
</p><p>me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.
</p><p>The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who
</p><p>could only use
</p><p>use his own feet as a means of transportation. My
</p><p>classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very
