                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ethnically and culturally homogenous societies make the interest of the family race and nation all the same. When dying for your nation is practically the same as dying for your family and race it’s citizens will have a fire in the heart to grow the nation to great strength and become citizens of high moral stature. This why countries like Germany were able to go from collapse to almost succeeding at conquering the world and raising their own living standards by 3 times at the same time. Their citizens went from each trying to protect their own bread crumbs to all contributing their lives for each other.</p><p></p><p>The controversy is that often more than not this creation of a homogenous society comes at the expense of another group of people.</p><p></p><p>history shows homogenous societies growing to great wealth and then other peoples wanting they wealth go to that society making it not so homogenous. As it loses its cultural strength the society loses its wealth collapses, fragments and out of one of the fragments a new homogenous society arises. This has happened for the last 6,000 years.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong pa brainliest po</p><br />

                            8. 9. What do yo think are the Advantage and disadvantageof heterogenization of culture?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The answer to this depends on the context you are thinking of.
</p><p>
</p><p>Generally speaking heterogeneity means diversity. It’s antonym would be homogenous or a variation thereof.
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a tendency to be diverse opens many doors and you would have an inquiring mind. This is not to say that every decision you would make would be fantastic or even good, but you are not of the homogenous aspect where you just “fit in” and go with the flow.
</p><p>
</p><p>In a microbiological aspect, heterogeneity can be seen in all virii. A virus needs a host to complete a sequence of DNA. Virii have RNA and are essentially inert until they can replicate with DNA. They are a good example of heterogeneity considering they can mutate rapidly and the adaptions produce a stronger version, while those that are weaker, are rejected or go into stasis until prompted to “rise”.
</p><p>
</p><p>The human body can be considered homogenous in it’s purest form, if all of the parts and organs are working correctly and in synch.
</p><p>
</p><p>Your question is not specific enough to take this beyond these basics. There are psychological, sociological, individual, sexual, and other aspects where the above would not suffice as an answer.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pabasa nalang po para maintindihan nyo slmt</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Advantages of heterogeneity:</strong>  </p><p>Variety

                            9. What do you think are the advantage and disadvantage of homogeniza of culture? How about heterogenization</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Advantages</p><p></p><p>1. Easier and likely better quality communication (although arguably difference forces one to examine one’s own culture more carefully , and may actually enhance how well you communicate its values ).</p><p>2. More global cooperation due to shared understanding of the world, shared goals, shared methodologies of achieving these. Arguably global cooperation requires a degree of similarity, values are shared in similar cultures.</p><p>3. Larger market for content (music, television etc) which is appealing to common interests and fads. Economies of scale achieved. More choice for consumers.</p><p>4. More predictability of other’s actions.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages</p><p></p><p>1. Less diversity of ideas. Different cultures are powerful experiments in seeing how else a society could work and provide examples to challenge existing norms and status quo. They provide inspiration for changes within any given culture.</p><p>2. Less ability to escape one’s own culture if you don't like it.</p><p>3. Blandness in uniformity. Most of us are fascinated to understand how a totally different system works.</p><p>4. There may be some aspect of “specialisation” that comes out of having different cultures. So there could be a net economic loss from this factor (in isolation)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. What do you think the advantages and disadvantages of heterogenization of culture?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abstract. The greatest advantage of heterogeneous catalysis is the ease of separation, while the disadvantages are often limited activity and selectivity. We report solvents that use tunable phase behavior to achieve homogeneous catalysis with ease of separation. Homogenization puts people on the same footing and improves communication and understanding. It has been redefined, incorrectly, as powerful cultures taking over weak ones. In reality, it is a negotiation between cultures and individuals, where good ideas are adopted from both. The down side is the changing of both (many) cultures, into the conglomerate.</p><p>heterogenization is border walls and pride and nationalism and power struggles. The upside is, you get to feel good about yourself.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>ADVANTAGES:<p></p><p>1. Intensifies learning opportunities. Being open to ideas and values of a different country introduces us to new learnings that are different to the ones that we currently know. This is because each and every country has their own opinion and specialty that differentiates them from one country to another.</p><p></p><p>2. Unifies the ties between countries. It is within the nature of people to help one another and join forces specially during tough times. Cultural heterogenization strengthens this idea more because when one country is treating the other country well, they will most likely will be allies and friends in the future generation. This will then help both countries economically in terms of employment, trade of goods, etc.</p><p></p>DISADVANTAGES:<p></p><p>1. Destroys local and traditional culture. As heterogenization practices other countries' religion and culture, it sometimes destroys the original culture of one country. As people specially teenagers and teens who grew up practicing different cultures will not be able to distinguish their own original culture which will lead to the death of a countries' local and traditional ways of doing things.</p><p></p><p>2. Sometimes leads to homogenization. As the former disadvantage only focuses on the confusion with one's original culture, homogenization on the other hand is the result when people in a country completely forgot about their local and original culture and are only following other countries' culture. This is the worst-case scenario that can happen if cultural heterogenization has taken on a higher level of influence over the people in one country.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous they are not chemically combined.,mixtures homogeneous a mixture is one that appears the same throughout.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You can buy high-end coffee drinks at espresso stands (either sit-down or ... Why would vinegar be considered a homogeneous mixture? ... of heterogeneous mixtures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>homogeneous mixture</strong> is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. The salt water described above is homogeneous because the dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire salt water sample. Often it is easy to confuse a homogeneous mixture with a pure substance because they are both uniform.  The difference is that the composition of the substance is always the same. The amount of salt in the salt water can vary from one sample to another. All solutions would be considered homogeneous because the dissolved material is present in the same amount throughout the solution.</p><p></p><p>One characteristic of mixtures is that they can be separated into their components. Since each part of the mixture has not reacted with another part of the mixture, the identities of the different materials is unchanged.</p><p></p><p>A <strong>heterogeneous mixture</strong> is a mixture in which the composition is not uniform throughout the mixture. Vegetable soup is a heterogeneous mixture. Any given spoonful of soup will contain varying amounts of the different vegetables and other components of the soup.</p><p></p><p>A phase is any part of a sample that has a uniform composition and properties. By definition, a pure substance or a homogeneous mixture consists of a single phase. A heterogeneous consists of two or more phases.  When oil and water are combined, they do not mix evenly, but instead form two separate layers. Each of the layers is called a phase.</p><br />

                        <p>Heterogeneity and homogeneity refer to the degree of diversity or similarity within a particular group or system.</p><p></p><p>In the context of culture, heterogeneity refers to the existence of diverse cultural practices, beliefs, and values within a society or group, while homogeneity refers to a shared cultural identity or a high degree of cultural uniformity. For example, a heterogeneous society may have different languages, religions, and traditions, while a homogeneous society may have a common language, religion, and set of cultural practices.</p><p></p><p>In politics, heterogeneity refers to a diverse range of political views, opinions, and interests within a society, while homogeneity refers to a high degree of political consensus or similarity of political beliefs. For example, a politically heterogeneous society may have different political parties and ideologies, while a politically homogeneous society may have a dominant political party or a single political ideology.</p><p></p><p>In economics, heterogeneity refers to differences in income, wealth, and economic opportunities within a society or group, while homogeneity refers to a more equal distribution of resources and economic outcomes. For example, an economically heterogeneous society may have a large income gap between the rich and poor, while an economically homogeneous society may have a more even distribution of income and wealth.</p><p></p><p>Overall, heterogeneity and homogeneity have important implications for the functioning and stability of societies and systems, and understanding these concepts can help us to better understand the challenges and opportunities that arise in different contexts.</p><br />

                        What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of homogenization of culture? how about heterogenization?
<p>
</p>There are others, but the main advantage of a homogeneous culture that I can think of is this: simply, people trust each other instinctively and conveniently because of a simple everyday awareness of each other's humanity.  When a population has all grown up in the same media, and under nearly the same conditions, and with roughly the same etiquette and knowledge of how the institutions of culture operate, it is simpler for them to empathize with each other. People seem to be kinder to those they understand, and in a homogeneous society, most people understand you fairly well.
When a slight is committed, people appear to be more sympathetic to the perpetrator. There is a common misconception in these cultures that people are mostly "healthy" with just a few "poor apples" to blame for much of society's problems.
<strong>Advantages</strong>
<p>1. Smoother and potentially improved communication efficiency (though it is possible the distance forces one to evaluate one's own culture more closely, and to ultimately improve how well you express its values).
</p><p>2. More global collaboration on the basis of mutual vision of the environment, shared goals, shared methodologies for achieving them. Global collaboration is likely to involve a degree of similarity, ideals are expressed in common societies.
</p><p>3. A wider demand for entertainment (music, media, etc.) that responds to common desires and fads. Achieved economies of scale. Many choices for customers.
</p><p>4. Greater predictability of the behavior of others.
</p>Disadvantages
<p>1. Less variety of proposals. Different societies are powerful tests to see how a society might function and offer examples to test current values and the status quo. They offer inspiration for changes within a given society.  </p><p>2. Less freedom to leave your own society if you don't like it.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Flameness of uniformity. Many of them are curious to learn how a radically new method operates.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. There may be an aspect of "specialization" that arises from possessing diverse cultures. There may then be a net economic loss from this aspect (in isolation)
</p><p><strong>Heterogenization</strong>
</p>It depends on how it's received. The advantages are that people have access to the latest they have from a certain perspective. The drawbacks are that they can spark feuds. In the other side, people will compete with each other (actually it might be more normal when they're only near enough to compete for the same space and not close enough to feel like "family").
However, I must argue that heterogenization of culture really is not the case. Look how many people know nothing about their society except, "Help, help, I'm being repressed" and know nothing about other cultures. Doesn't it sound like they're getting more and more heterogeneous?<p></p><p>  </p><p><strong>For more information visit this link:  </strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/4736628

Arguably global cooperation requires a degree of similarity, values are shared in similar cultures.</p><p></p><p>3. Larger market for content (music, television etc) which is appealing to common interests and fads. Economies of scale achieved. More choice for consumers.</p><p></p><p>4. More predictability of other's actions.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages</p><p></p><p>1. Less diversity of ideas. Different cultures are powerful experiments in seeing how else a society could work and provide examples to challenge existing norms and status quo. They provide inspiration for changes within any given culture.</p><p></p><p>2. Less ability to escape one's own culture if you don't like it.</p><p></p><p>3. Blandness in uniformity. Most of us are fascinated to understand how a totally different system works.</p><p></p><p>4. There may be some aspect of "specialisation" that comes out of having different cultures. So there could be a net economic loss from this factor (in isolation)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SANA NAKA TULONG:&gt;</p><p></p><br />
