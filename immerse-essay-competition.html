                            9. write an essay about values and attributes of a senior high school student in work immersion ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Senior high school students who undergo work immersion programs have a unique opportunity to acquire practical knowledge, skills, and values necessary for their future careers. Work immersion programs expose students to a professional work environment and allow them to experience the demands and challenges of real-world work. As such, it is essential for senior high school students to develop specific values and attributes that will help them excel in their work immersion experiences.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important values that a senior high school student should possess during work immersion is professionalism. Professionalism refers to the ability to behave appropriately, responsibly, and ethically in a work environment. This includes dressing appropriately, arriving on time, being reliable and dependable, and communicating effectively with colleagues and supervisors. Professionalism also involves having a positive attitude, being willing to learn, and taking responsibility for one's actions.</p><p></p><p>Another critical value for senior high school students in work immersion is adaptability. The ability to adapt to new situations and environments is crucial, particularly in work immersion programs that expose students to different types of work and industries. Adaptability includes being open-minded, flexible, and willing to learn new skills and concepts. Students who are adaptable can adjust to changes in the work environment quickly, work well with others, and handle unexpected situations with ease.</p><p></p><p>Communication is also an essential attribute for senior high school students in work immersion. Effective communication involves the ability to express oneself clearly and listen actively to others. Senior high school students who communicate well can ask questions, give and receive feedback, and work collaboratively with others. Strong communication skills are crucial in any work environment, and students who can communicate effectively will have an advantage in their future careers.</p><p></p><p>Another attribute that senior high school students should develop during work immersion is initiative. Initiative refers to the ability to take action without being told what to do. Senior high school students who take initiative can identify problems, propose solutions, and take steps to implement those solutions. This attribute is particularly valuable in work environments that require creative problem-solving, innovation, and self-motivation.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a senior high school student in work immersion should develop a strong work ethic. Work ethic refers to the values and principles that guide one's work habits and performance. Students with a strong work ethic are diligent, disciplined, and committed to their work. They take pride in their work, are accountable for their actions, and are willing to go above and beyond what is expected of them. Developing a strong work ethic during work immersion will prepare senior high school students for the demands of the professional world and help them achieve success in their future careers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, work immersion programs provide senior high school students with an invaluable opportunity to gain practical knowledge, skills, and values necessary for their future careers.

Specifically, the students are able to: (1) gain relevant and practical industrial skills under the guidance of industry experts and workers; (ii) appreciate the importance and application of the principles and theories taught in school, enhance their technical knowledge and skills; (iv) enrich their skills in communications and human relation; and (v) develop good work habits, attitudes, appreciation, and respect for work. These prepare them to meet the needs and challenges of employment or higher education after employment. Work Immersion provides the students with a venue to test themselves and apply what they have learned in a non-school scenario. The learners are not only able to apply their previous training but are also able to experience the social interactions in a work environment. Their experiences during work immersion will develop many skills and values that would help them as they transition from high school to real life.</p><p></p><p>To assure the achievement of the objectives of Work Immersion in the Philippines, the Department of Education issued DepEd Order No. 30, s. 2017 which serves as the basis in the implementation of work immersion in all Senior High Schools (SHSS). The policy serves to guide SHSS in: (i) creating flexible work immersion arrangement for their learners; (ii) providing options for work immersion that are relevant to learners' purposes and needs; (iii) organizing work immersion opportunities for learners that are consistent with the diverse human resource requirements for partner institutions for work immersion; and (iv) articulating the scope and limits of work immersion in the context of basic education when building relationships with work immersion partners. To assess the learners' performance during the Work Immersion, the Work Immersion Teacher and the Work Immersion Partner Institution Supervisor will jointly assess the learners' performance following DepEd Order No. 8, 2015.</p><p></p><p>As a Grade 12 student. I was given the chance to undergo the Work Immersion for a duration of two weeks. In preparation, I accomplished the needed requirements and documents first before I was qualified for the immersion. I was assigned to the Philippine National Police station. In our Work Immersion, I was able to experience the day-to-day activities of the PNP such as road checkpoint, flyer distribution, moral activity, community service, gun assembling, and earthquake drills. During this period, I learned a lot of things that helped me understand and appreciate the work of our police officers. I got first-hand experiences wherein I was able to apply and improve my prior knowledge and skills.</p><br />

My answer has always been this is the Independence which I yearned for in terms of ideals as well as vision.</p><p></p><p>Only that the reality of being an independent country, in our case, carries difficulties and enormous challenges not only for those who govern but also for the whole population.</p><p></p><p>The building of a nation is a process and the process itself will, of course, take time. Whether short or long term it depends on the policies and programs of those who are tasked with the responsibility to produce.</p><p></p><p>Timor-Leste is in this situation.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO INADEQUATE COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE.</p><p>             Of the vast assortment of possible solutions to inadequate computer knowledge, four stand out as superior: Automated personal computers, Instruction Manuals, Hands on Learning, and Computer Based Training. The most adequate criteria by which to judge the advantages of these four options are cost of Computer-Aid, Performance of Computers vs. Manual Labor, and Reasonable ways to incorporate computers.</p><p>             Introduction of Possible Solutions.</p><p>             Automated Personal Computers.</p><p>             Personal Computers that would be able to help everyone regardless of whether or not the person would be blind, illiterate, or those who have a hard time understanding computers. Automated Personal Computers could make that possible for everyone. With a voice command and detailed descriptions of your work, why would it not be simple to have a better understanding of computers? However, it has its advantages and disadvantages: The work would become easier but it will also cause people to lose jobs. The overall cost of this new technology would be far beyond demand but it will also be well worth it. You would look into about almost $1,000 per household or even more just to attain this type of technology. Automated Personal Computers seem to be the coming of the new age and pretty soon may even be what the world revolves around.</p><p>             Instruction Manuals.</p><p>             It would possibly be simpler to attain information more efficient by words than to attain the information by screen but it is also a longer process to do so. With instruction manuals, you may end up reading for 48 hours and still not understand what you were trying to in the first place. Instruction Manuals would also be considered a way to incorporate manual labor without outright saying so. In order to use this process of learning, you must first purchase and then sit and set aside hours in order to even began to understand this method</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>k</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>w</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>"</strong></p><p></p><p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>The K-12 curriculum just recently started rolling in the country's current educational system. One of the newest curriculum's salient feature is the additional two years in the secondary level which consequently gave way to the division of the secondary level, now having the so-called Junior High School and Senior High School. The Junior high School constitutes the grades 7 to 10 and the Senior High School constitutes the additional two years, grades 11 and 12.</p><p>      With the emergence and implementation of the K-12 curriculum this only means, a new subjects will be offered especially in the Senior High School. One subject is the work immersion. A pre-requisite for graduation and a preparation for possible job application after graduation. For now, let us just focus first on the idea, to prepare for possible job application after graduation.</p><p>      Whether you agree or not, work immersion is a good platform to showcase your self, your skills, talents and everything that you can do. From that, you can be absorbed as a regular employee immediately after graduation in the same company you are deployed during the work immersion. So the question now, how to impress and or conduct yourself in the company where you will be assigned?</p><p>       First, before going to immersing yourself to the company, know first its background. It is from knowing the background of the company that you can be able to prepare yourself as you start working. Second, show good impression. It is very important to show good impression as early as the first day. Do not be late. Always smile. Greet everyone. Just express your enthusiasm working with your boss and with your co-workers. Third, look good. The magic words are, Dress to Impress. There might be misconception on this one. It does not mean that you have to dress up with clothes which are newly bought and or expensive, instead, you can wear simple, not costly yet elegant clothes, as what people say, simplicity is beauty. The only standard you have to meet is that, you have to look formal. Lastly, always express the vibe that you can be approached by your co-workers and or boss, and that you can be relied on. Made an impression that you can do your work effectively, efficiently, and independently.</p><p>       But one thing to remember, these things are just guides. More so, these are not constant. Some of these may not work for you or in the company where you will be assigned, therefore, you can still make adjustments depending on the situation you will find yourself in.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#LearnWithBrainly</p><p></p><p>_________</p><p>Additional information can be extracted from these links below:</p><p>Objectives od work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2643861</p><p>Importance of work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2490649</p><p>Benefits of work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2585584</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
