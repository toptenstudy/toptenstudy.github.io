                                            For years, Indonesia was dominated by foreign countries especially from Europe. The political strife Indonesia suffered from 1500 until 1949 can be the basis of the poem, "To Gadis." Read the poem below. Then, answer the questions that follow.To Gadisby Chairil AnwarAmidstThe green leavesThe light and open fields,Innocent children just able to crawl, the fresh, invigorating rain.Sweet-singing birds,A young nation rises that can just say "I"And thenThe crisp dry wind, the scorched earth, The swirling sand blown back,The evacuated land.We are wedged in And forced to shrink, grow small, Able to move a step only now and then.Let us free ourselves, our souls, become A winging dove,Fly And know the fields without meeting and withoutThe consummation of flight.Comprehension Questions:1. What images are used to characterize this situation in the first stanza?2. What literal situation is depicted in it?3. As a Filipino, what is your dream for the nation?4. Why is Indonesia described as "A young nation... that can just say 'I"? 5. Why do people need to write about their own country's struggles and how they fought to attain freedom and liberty?​</a>

                                            Mango PoemRegie CabicoMother fetches the fruit from the mango behind closed bamboo. Rips its paper-leather cover during midday recess, before English class, describes their dance peaches plums cantaloupes before my first-world        eyes. When the sun blazed on the dust,Where the mangos were first planted, mother, an infant, hid under gravel swaddled by Lola, my grandmother, after my mother’s aunt and unclewere tied to the trunk        and stabbed  by the Japanese. Mother and daughter living off        fallen mangos, the pits planted in darkness,        before I was born.We left the Philippines        for California dodging U.S. Customs with the forbidden fruit,        thinking who’d deprive mother of her mangos. Head down, my father denies that we have perishable        foods, waving passports in the still air, motioning for us        to proceed towards the terminal. Behind a long line of travelers, my sisters surround mother like shoji screens as she hides the newspaper-covered fruit between her legs. Mangos sleepingin the hammock of her skirt, a brilliant batik        billowing from the motion of airline caddies pushing suitcases        on metal carts. We walk around mother        forming a crucifix where she was center. On the plane as we cross time zones, mom unwraps her ripe mangos, the ones from the tree Lola planted before she gave birth to my mother, the daughter that left home to be a nurse in the States,        who’d marry a Filipino navy man        and have three children of her own. Mother eating the fruit whose juices rain       over deserts and cornfields.Guide Questions:1.	Where does the narrator’s family live at the start of the poem?2.	Why did the narrator’s family left their place?3.	What specific time or era do you think this story happened?4.	Why the story is entitled Mango?​</a>

Coldplay and winter mist set in  Ruins of love clinch an endless echo    - taunting the very merry memory. The auditory sensation of broken trust     - stride across the way. Icing every thought in a sullen, cold rink.  She fell - She crumbled    - In a world where hope once existed Today, she will sway alone without a lullaby Answer the following questions.                                             On every mid-moon, she stares and         stares towards the old shriveled lipstick       on his pillow       Unseen coldness, unsatisfied,                                incomplete tears          She can feel the complete braille of hate cascade around the emptiness.  Throughout her poise frostbite travels in      Midnight Summer dreams are near an end         Autumn bones covered by winter sleet  A deadly force condemns all because of  one  Lost years crumbled like an avalanche           Way deep down inside.

A nest of robins in her hair Upon whose bosom snow has lain Who intimately lives with rain Poems are made by fools like me But only God can make a tree. ​</a>

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames

To thy chamber window, Sweet! The wandering airs they faint On the dark, the silent stream— The Champak odours fail Like sweet thoughts in a dream; The Nightingale's complaint, It dies upon her heart;— As I must on thine, Oh, belovèd as thou art! Oh lift me from the grass! I die! I faint! I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain On my lips and eyelids pale. My cheek is cold and white, alas! My heart beats loud and fast;— Oh! press it to thine own again, Where it will break at last. why is the poem entitled "the Indian Serenade"?Trace the emotional pattern of the poem.Is the second line of the last stanza an example of climax or anticlimax?Defend the arrangement of ideas in it. </a>

by Daniel Whitehead Hicky
You who have grown so intimate with stars 
And know their silver dripping from your wings, 
Swept with the breaking day across the sky, 
Known kinship with each meteor that swings—
You who have touched the rainbow’s fragile gold, 
Carved lyric ways through dawn and dusk and rain 
And soared to heights our hearts have only dreamed—
How can you walk earth’s common ways again?

When the sun blazed on the dust,Where the mangos were first planted, mother, an infant, hid under gravel swaddled by Lola, my grandmother, after my mother’s aunt and unclewere tied to the trunk        and stabbed  by the Japanese. Mother and daughter living off        fallen mangos, the pits planted in darkness,        before I was born.We left the Philippines        for California dodging U.S. Customs with the forbidden fruit,        thinking who’d deprive mother of her mangos. Head down, my father denies that we have perishable        foods, waving passports in the still air, motioning for us        to proceed towards the terminal. Behind a long line of travelers, my sisters surround mother like shoji screens as she hides the newspaper-covered fruit between her legs. Mangos sleepingin the hammock of her skirt, a brilliant batik        billowing from the motion of airline caddies pushing suitcases        on metal carts. We walk around mother        forming a crucifix where she was center. On the plane as we cross time zones, mom unwraps her ripe mangos, the ones from the tree Lola planted before she gave birth to my mother, the daughter that left home to be a nurse in the States,        who’d marry a Filipino navy man        and have three children of her own. Mother eating the fruit whose juices rain       over deserts and cornfields.Guide Questions:1.	Where does the narrator’s family live at the start of the poem?2.	Why did the narrator’s family left their place?3.	What specific time or era do you think this story happened?4.	Why the story is entitled Mango?​</h2><br />

                            15.                                          Black Ice    Sorrow flows from the first sunrise  Eyes deeper than winter and rainfall A painful combination never felt before  At core death awaits    - laughing while she begs for clemency! In her eyes, fault is found in every sunset    - after coming down from cloud nine. Impossible to move --- her body stiffen That very moment, A precious Waltz - Expired! Coldplay and winter mist set in  Ruins of love clinch an endless echo    - taunting the very merry memory. The auditory sensation of broken trust     - stride across the way. Icing every thought in a sullen, cold rink.  She fell - She crumbled    - In a world where hope once existed Today, she will sway alone without a lullaby Answer the following questions.                                             On every mid-moon, she stares and         stares towards the old shriveled lipstick       on his pillow       Unseen coldness, unsatisfied,                                incomplete tears          She can feel the complete braille of hate cascade around the emptiness.  Throughout her poise frostbite travels in      Midnight Summer dreams are near an end         Autumn bones covered by winter sleet  A deadly force condemns all because of  one  Lost years crumbled like an avalanche           Way deep down inside. She paints the rain like no other           heartache          Leaving winter residue behind every         step                                       "Black Ice" sits close to the cold canvas        on her pale        LET US REFLECT  1.     What does the poem tell you about its message?

I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

To thy chamber window, Sweet! The wandering airs they faint On the dark, the silent stream— The Champak odours fail Like sweet thoughts in a dream; The Nightingale's complaint, It dies upon her heart;— As I must on thine, Oh, belovèd as thou art! Oh lift me from the grass! I die! I faint! I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain On my lips and eyelids pale. My cheek is cold and white, alas! My heart beats loud and fast;— Oh! press it to thine own again, Where it will break at last. why is the poem entitled "the Indian Serenade"?Trace the emotional pattern of the poem.Is the second line of the last stanza an example of climax or anticlimax?Defend the arrangement of ideas in it. </h2><br />
                        <p>"The Indian Serenade" is a love poem composed by P.B Shelley in the request of Miss Sophia Stacey, the singer in 1819. Basically it was created as a song and it was first published in 1882 under the title "Song Written For an Indian Air". Later it was included in Posthumous Poems as a title "Lines to an Indian Air". The subject matter of the poem is quite simple and it is completely based on Love.</p><br />

                            26. THE SONG IS BELIEVER
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</h2><br />

by Daniel Whitehead Hicky
You who have grown so intimate with stars 
And know their silver dripping from your wings, 
Swept with the breaking day across the sky, 
Known kinship with each meteor that swings—
You who have touched the rainbow’s fragile gold, 
Carved lyric ways through dawn and dusk and rain 
And soared to heights our hearts have only dreamed—
How can you walk earth’s common ways again?
