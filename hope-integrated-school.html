On Good Manners, Right Conduct, and Values EducationPresident duterte signed a bill in to law that restores subjects like good manners, right conduct, and values education. Proponents of Republic Act 11476 hope that the new law is implementing rules and regulations will be realesed in time for the upcoming school year so that the subjects can be included in the curriculum. The law is passed at a time when the country is fighting a fatal pandemic. In response to the public health crisis the issues raised is RA 11476 need to be considered. The measure, according to Pasig Rep. Roman Romulo, who chairs the House committee on basic education and culture, will help instill basic tenets in the youth such as "caring for oneself, giving concern for others, according to proper respect for people, uphold discipline and oerder, cultivate sincerity, honesty, obedience and, above all, country love." In 2013,Good Manners and Right Conduct subjects were phased out and replace with Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao. GMRC will be integrated into daily activities in kindergarden and taught as a seperate subject in Grade 1-6 under the new law. Frome Grade 7-10, GMRC will be integrated into the Values Education subject. For Grade 11 and 12, Values Education will be integrated intoall subjects. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is best contained by the country's adopted slogan:healing as one. It necessitates being mindful of one's health and the health of others - we stay healthy so that we do not infect others, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, for  whom COVID-19 infection could be fatal. GMRC and Values Education can help promote the behaviors and attitudes necessary for success in the fight against COVID-19. Public officials from the President down should lead by example and show manners, in both word and deed. Aside from the pandemic, practically every aspect of life can benefit from good manners, proper conduct, and proper values. It is past time to give the subjects the attention the deserve.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

                                            Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens.

He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</a>

On Good Manners, Right Conduct, and Values EducationPresident duterte signed a bill in to law that restores subjects like good manners, right conduct, and values education. Proponents of Republic Act 11476 hope that the new law is implementing rules and regulations will be realesed in time for the upcoming school year so that the subjects can be included in the curriculum. The law is passed at a time when the country is fighting a fatal pandemic. In response to the public health crisis the issues raised is RA 11476 need to be considered. The measure, according to Pasig Rep. Roman Romulo, who chairs the House committee on basic education and culture, will help instill basic tenets in the youth such as "caring for oneself, giving concern for others, according to proper respect for people, uphold discipline and oerder, cultivate sincerity, honesty, obedience and, above all, country love." In 2013,Good Manners and Right Conduct subjects were phased out and replace with Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao. GMRC will be integrated into daily activities in kindergarden and taught as a seperate subject in Grade 1-6 under the new law. Frome Grade 7-10, GMRC will be integrated into the Values Education subject. For Grade 11 and 12, Values Education will be integrated intoall subjects. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is best contained by the country's adopted slogan:healing as one. It necessitates being mindful of one's health and the health of others - we stay healthy so that we do not infect others, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, for  whom COVID-19 infection could be fatal. GMRC and Values Education can help promote the behaviors and attitudes necessary for success in the fight against COVID-19. Public officials from the President down should lead by example and show manners, in both word and deed. Aside from the pandemic, practically every aspect of life can benefit from good manners, proper conduct, and proper values. It is past time to give the subjects the attention the deserve.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

                            6. Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens.

Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do.
