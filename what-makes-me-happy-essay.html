                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</a>

                            5. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />
