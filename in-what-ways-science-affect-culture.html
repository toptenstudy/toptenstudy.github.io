                        <strong>The Ways Science Affects Culture</strong><p></p><strong>Science is a result of systematic efforts</strong> with <strong>the scientific method</strong> in the development and organization of knowledge.

By definition, science is a way to study certain aspects of nature in a systematic, organized, and through various scientific methods.</p><p> </p>While <strong>culture is the overall attitude and pattern of behavior</strong> of a person or group as well as knowledge which is a habit that is inherited from their ancestors and is owned by a member of a particular society. Culture affects many aspects of life, such as religion, customs, politics, language, clothing, buildings, and others.<p> </p><p>Science and culture have a relationship with each other. Science is a science or a scientific fact that comes from repeated experiments or tests and is born with a specific purpose in an aspect of life. The scientific system or knowledge system is never separated from the cultural context or in other words the culture of knowledge.</p><p> </p><p>According to Timothy Lenoir, science is knowledge resulting from the interpretation of an object of knowledge and an observer (interpreter) who does not stand apart from one another. </p><p>Interpretation is a cultural practice <strong>that involves cognitive factors</strong> (which are related to mentality) and <strong>social factors</strong> that are interconnected with each other. These two factors are always attached to the actors of <strong>knowledge production (scientists).</strong></p><p>Therefore, it can be concluded from Lenior's argument that the understanding of science as a cultural practice is not local, partial, and based on individual or group interests.</p><p> </p><p>Science influences culture <strong>based on the results of experiments conducted by scientists</strong> on objects in all aspects of life, so this affects <strong>the values ​​that apply to society</strong>. These values ​​are basically present in various ways, and creativity is the basic manifestation of these values.</p><p></p><p>brainly.ph/question/2023062</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
