                                            Legend of the Philippines At one time, there was just the sky, the sea, and the crow flying between them. The crow got tired of flying, but could find no place to sit, and stirred up the sea. When the waters of the sea reached the sky, it threw rocks, to keep it down. These rocks then became the islands of the Philippines. The crow flew down again and lived peacefully on one of the islands; when one day a bamboo struck its feet. Hurt and angry, the crow started pecking the bamboo until it split in two- thus Malakas, meaning strong, and Maganda, meaning beautiful, were born. Malakas and Maganda were married and had numerous children. One day, fed up with the constant racket of the children, they started beating them up. Terrified, the children fled all over the place, and became the different people living on the islands.

That's among the highest rates in the world -- and the figures were recorded before the most recent lockdown that started in March.(3)-Desperate to avoid more lockdowns and kickstart the faltering economy, the government is now pinning its hopes on vaccines.(4)But while health experts say vaccination is a crucial tool in bringing an end to the pandemic, many Filipinos are skeptical, and vaccination take-up remains dangerously low.(5)-The economic turmoil began last March when Philippines President Rodrigo DuterteSOCIAL:MORAL:ECONOMIC:​</a>

Write your answer on the space provided.Street Children in ManilaWith over 17 million inhabitants, Manila keeps on growing. The city is thecapital of the Philippines and one of the most spread out megalopolises in theworld. Estimates suggest that in the shadow of unplanned and rapid development,between 250,000 and 1 million children live in the streets. Left to fend forthemselves, they are easy prey for gangs and trafficking. Often living one day at atime, they need help, more so than anyone else.The children we meet in the streets are between 7 and 20 years old. Someof them try to earn a living by doing small street work such as filling the jeepneys(small local buses), begging, gathering clients for vendors in the markets or sortingrubbish. By working thus, they earn in between 50 and 120 pesos every day.However, most of the children we meet loiter in the streets, they often endup sniffing glue. Some of them belong to gangs, trapped in the grasps of adultswho are part of trafficking networks. These children are much harder to meet, theirgang tattoos allow them to recognize one another, they depend on their gang'sboss, whom they fear, but who can also defend them.​</a>

A health article also states that the thinking and emotional development during the first five years of a child is crucial. Allowing them to spend more than two hours a day can impact irreversible damage such as slow cognitive development and attention deficit.QUESTIONS 5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1."An apple a day keeps the doctor away." This is a common saying that Emphasizes the importance of eating a healthy diet and taking care of one's health. While eating an apple every day may not completely prevent someone from needing to see a doctor, consuming a balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables is beneficial for overall health.</p><p></p><p>2."Vaccine is the solution to this pandemic." This statement is supported by scientific evidence and consensus among public health experts. Vaccines have been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in ending the pandemic and returning to normalcy.</p><p></p><p>3."The Philippines is the happiest country in the world." This statement is subjective and depends on various factors such as the methodology used in the survey, the sample size, and the demographics of the respondents. While the Philippines may have scored high in a particular survey, it does not necessarily mean that it is the happiest country in the world. Happiness is a complex and multifaceted concept that is difficult to measure objectively.</p><p></p><p>4."Children must respect parents and elderly all the times." This statement emphasizes the importance of respecting one's elders and is a common cultural value in many societies. However, respect is a two-way street, and it is important for parents and elderly individuals to also show respect to children and younger generations. Additionally, respect should not be automatic or unconditional, and it is important for individuals to earn respect through their actions and behavior.</p><br />

                            5. Legend of the Philippines At one time, there was just the sky, the sea, and the crow flying between them. The crow got tired of flying, but could find no place to sit, and stirred up the sea. When the waters of the sea reached the sky, it threw rocks, to keep it down. These rocks then became the islands of the Philippines. The crow flew down again and lived peacefully on one of the islands; when one day a bamboo struck its feet. Hurt and angry, the crow started pecking the bamboo until it split in two- thus Malakas, meaning strong, and Maganda, meaning beautiful, were born. Malakas and Maganda were married and had numerous children. One day, fed up with the constant racket of the children, they started beating them up. Terrified, the children fled all over the place, and became the different people living on the islands.

Write your answer on the space provided.Street Children in ManilaWith over 17 million inhabitants, Manila keeps on growing. The city is thecapital of the Philippines and one of the most spread out megalopolises in theworld. Estimates suggest that in the shadow of unplanned and rapid development,between 250,000 and 1 million children live in the streets. Left to fend forthemselves, they are easy prey for gangs and trafficking. Often living one day at atime, they need help, more so than anyone else.The children we meet in the streets are between 7 and 20 years old. Someof them try to earn a living by doing small street work such as filling the jeepneys(small local buses), begging, gathering clients for vendors in the markets or sortingrubbish. By working thus, they earn in between 50 and 120 pesos every day.However, most of the children we meet loiter in the streets, they often endup sniffing glue. Some of them belong to gangs, trapped in the grasps of adultswho are part of trafficking networks. These children are much harder to meet, theirgang tattoos allow them to recognize one another, they depend on their gang'sboss, whom they fear, but who can also defend them.​</h2><br />
