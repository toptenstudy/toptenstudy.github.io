                            8. Give the OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS of the issuesPOVERTYUNEMPLOYMENTCORRUPTION ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>POVERTY:</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 1: Poverty is not solely the result of economic factors, but rather a combination of individual choices and circumstances. Individuals who are living in poverty are often blamed for their situation, and it is assumed that they are lazy or not motivated to improve their situation. Opponents of poverty reduction programs argue that these programs create a culture of dependence, discouraging individuals from taking responsibility for their own lives.</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 2: Poverty reduction programs are not effective in addressing the root causes of poverty. These programs provide temporary relief for those in need, but do not address the structural inequalities that create and perpetuate poverty. Opponents argue that poverty reduction programs are a Band-Aid solution that does not lead to long-term change.</p><p></p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT:</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 1: Unemployment is a natural part of a market economy and is necessary for economic growth. Unemployment creates a pool of available workers, which allows employers to hire workers at a lower cost, leading to lower prices for goods and services. Opponents of unemployment benefits argue that they create a disincentive for individuals to seek work, leading to increased unemployment in the long term.</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 2: Unemployment benefits create a culture of dependency that discourages individuals from seeking work. Opponents of unemployment benefits argue that these programs create a disincentive for individuals to seek work, as they are able to rely on government assistance instead. Additionally, opponents argue that unemployment benefits create a burden on taxpayers, leading to increased government spending and a larger national debt.</p><p></p><p>CORRUPTION:</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 1: Corruption is a necessary part of doing business in some countries, and is not necessarily a negative thing. In some cases, corruption can be used to expedite bureaucratic processes, leading to increased efficiency and economic growth. Opponents of anti-corruption measures argue that they are overly burdensome and create unnecessary barriers to doing business.</p><p></p><p>Opposing viewpoint 2: Anti-corruption measures are ineffective and create unnecessary barriers to economic growth. Opponents of anti-corruption measures argue that they are overly complex and difficult to enforce, leading to increased bureaucracy and decreased economic efficiency. Additionally, opponents argue that anti-corruption measures can be used to unfairly target businesses and individuals, leading to a negative impact on economic growth</p><br />

                            10. Is the title of the essay " Fighting poverty in the Philippines " appropriate?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>It should be a perfect title if it could describe all poverty matters very well. </strong>Poverty in the Philippines is more pervasive and chronic than in surrounding ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) t nations. While the Philippines' poverty rate has fallen over the previous quarter century, the decline has been slower than in other ASEAN nations. Past economic policies that slowed growth by discriminating against agriculture and discouraging investment in human capital are partially to blame for the Philippines' sluggish progress in lowering the incidence of poverty.  These policies reinforced powerful interest groups that prevented or delayed economic progress.</p><p>In contrast, the Philippines initiated political and economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and since 1994, annual GDP growth has increased to approximately 5 %.  With quicker growth, the proportion of Filipinos living below the poverty line is dropping, but agricultural reform and higher investment in human capital would allow for a more significant decline. </p><p></p><p><strong>Learn More about the essay title:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/25826173?referrer=searchResults</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I could advice our President, His Excellency the President of the RP, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, I would impose my beliefs into my advice for the president. I am an authoritarian capitalist who advocates for laissez-faire markets, strong statism, a delicate balance of tradition and progress and proud nationalism.</p><p></p><p>I. Let the Markets Free</p><p></p><p>I would encourage the president to impose a laissez-faire policy when dealing with economic markets. Government regulation always leads to more obstacles for business owners and often prevents entrpreneurs from making their ideas come to market because the government always taxes them too much, imposes restrictions on where they can operate, force them to pay massive fees for registration and much more. And if entrepreneurs cannot get past these bureaucratic hurdles and establish their business or company, they cannot make jobs and people will not get employed. Government regulation will keep people from getting employed easily because fewer business owners and entrepreneurs can get past their hurdles. If the government will remove its bureaucratic red tape, the markets shall be opened for limitless business growth that will drive economic growth. The Government should be encouraging native entrepreneurship, not shutting them off.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps^-^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Addressing poverty and unemployment requires a multi-faceted approach that includes policies to promote economic growth, job creation, social protection, education and skills training, and sustainable development.

By focusing on these areas, the government can create job opportunities and increase the income of Filipinos, which can help alleviate poverty.</p><p></p><p>Create more job opportunities - The government can work to create more job opportunities by providing incentives for businesses to invest in the country and promoting the growth of emerging industries. This can be achieved through targeted tax policies, regulatory reforms, and streamlined bureaucratic processes that can help businesses grow and thrive.</p><p></p><p>Provide social protection programs - The government can provide social protection programs such as cash transfers, food assistance, and healthcare subsidies to help the poorest Filipinos meet their basic needs.

This can help reduce the impact of climate change and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all Filipinos, including future generations.</p><br />

To increase employment, non-literate people can be taught a few skills to make them employable.</p><p><strong>Increase Access to Proper Sanitation and Clean Water. </strong>Access to clean water and sanitation directly affects health and education. Currently, 800 million people live without access to safe water and 2.5 billion live without adequate sanitation. Lack of clean water spreads diseases like diarrhea and cholera, which take the lives of more than one million children each year.</p><p><strong>End the poverty tax. </strong>People living in low-income neighborhoods pay extra for most everything, from food to car loans, and are dependent upon high-interest “pay-day loans” because many banks won’t serve poor neighborhoods.  </p><p><strong>Educate Everyone. </strong>Education helps increase individual earnings for every member of a family. UNESCO points out that basic reading skills can lift 171 million people out of extreme poverty, ultimately reducing the world’s total poverty by 12 percent. UNESCO also mentions there are currently about one billion illiterate adults in the world.</p><p>While the issue about the unemployment of Pilipino's especially during this pandemic can be resolved by:</p><p><strong>Bringing up the importance to employment programs. </strong>  In five year plans more importance should be given to employment. The programs like irrigation, roads, flood control, power, agriculture, rural electrification can provide better employment to people.</p><p><strong>Reducing Occupational Immobility.</strong> the government can provide retraining programs for the unemployed, so that they can improve their skills or gain new skills necessary to ensure their employment.</p><p><strong>Employment Subsidies. </strong>Employment subsidies can be provided by the government for firms who hire workers that are unemployed. With a subsidy, costs of production for firms go down since the price of each unit of labour resource decreases. Hence, employers will be more willing and able to hire more workers and increase the number of workers that they are willing to hire. This increases the size of the workforce and the number of job vacancies, hence helping to reduce unemployment. </p><p>And the final step must be done to eradicate the issues by <strong>Taking Action.</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong>here's no shortcuts to success. That's why I would also advise the President of the Philippines to don't lose hope because if you want to achieve something in life, you need to work hard. you need to live with determination, you need to have patience, and we must keep in mind that experiences help us to grow and currently what you are experiencing is not a permanent situation but a temporary state of mind or being.  The future is unknown and instead of feeling fear of the unknown, try to embrace it.</p><br />
