(Reference: STS MODULE)
Gerald Manley Hopkins wrote a poem in 1877, which he entitled God’s Grandeur. Read the poem and pay attention to the words that really made an impact on you.
The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generation have trod, have trod, have trod; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wear man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil Is bare now, now can feet feel, being shod. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last light off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, spring— Because the holy Ghost over the bent World brood with warm breast and with ah! Bright wings.

                            27. ACTIVITY 1: Read the poem below and analyze it. 
(Reference: STS MODULE)
Gerald Manley Hopkins wrote a poem in 1877, which he entitled God’s Grandeur. Read the poem and pay attention to the words that really made an impact on you.
The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generation have trod, have trod, have trod; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wear man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil Is bare now, now can feet feel, being shod. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last light off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, spring— Because the holy Ghost over the bent World brood with warm breast and with ah! Bright wings.
Answer the following questions:
1. Is the poem related to the previous lesson? How? If it is not related, explain why.
2. What does the poem say about human ability to know and to create?
3. How is technology referred to in the poem? 
ACTIVTY 2: Read the application/assessment part of the module and answer the question below.
1. So, after having considered the excerpts from the Nicomachean Ethics, how is téchn? related to epist?m??</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Activity 1:1. The poem is not directly related to the previous lesson, which is not specified in the prompt. However, it can be related to the theme of the appreciation of nature, which is discussed in science and technology studies (STS).2. The poem suggests that human beings have lost touch with nature and are preoccupied with materialistic pursuits, such as trade and toil. However, despite this, the poem implies that there is still hope for humanity, as nature remains resilient and enduring. The poem does not directly address human ability to know and create.3. Technology is not directly referred to in the poem, but the negative impact of trade and toil on the environment can be interpreted as a critique of industrialization and modernization.Activity 2:1. The Greek words téchn? and epist?m? are related in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in the sense that téchn? refers to practical knowledge or craft, while epist?m? refers to theoretical knowledge or science. The distinction between the two types of knowledge is important in Aristotle's philosophy, as they have different aims and methods. Téchn? aims at producing a product or achieving a goal, while epist?m? aims at understanding the nature and causes of things. However, both téchn? and epist?m? require phronesis, or practical wisdom, which enables one to use knowledge in a virtuous way. Thus, téchn? and epist?m? are related in the sense that they both require phronesis to be used properly.<strong>Explanation:</strong>MAKE ME BRANLISTCARRYING ON LEARNING<br />
