                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Bullying is a very massive topic. As you go see what the world of bullying you'll see cruelty and feel the pain and pity for the victim. They say, a child is being like that because of his parents, because of the lack of attention. Well, yeah. I agree with that argument. I agree that it always come from your parents. Why so? The influence. The biggest influence a child would look up to is to his parents. </p><p></p><p>Discrimination, physical and mental abuse are worst. It can lead us to serious problems. It can cause us problem socializing, problem to speak up for ourself and it can lose ourselves. You see, a simple laugh, laughing to a girl that has been tripped is a very serious one. A child's brain is still developing! Open your eyes for change! Don't stick with that; he'll change, this is not serious. Open your eyes for change. Focus on the victim,  not to the bully. Fine! He might have his reasons for bullying someone but how about the victim? Again, bullying is a serious matter. It can cause you a lot of trouble and as you see the one who bullied you, everything will go back in time, in time where, you are being laughed, being shouted, being tripped, being discriminated. Focus on the brain, focus on the hypothalamus of the victim, and you'll see, what I'm talking about. </p><br />

                        <p>Own your image, personal information and how these are used. Pay close attention to the Terms of Use on apps and websites. Most people skim through them to accept immediately, but it’s wise to take a closer look and read all the sections thoroughly. In some situations, you can opt out of automatic facial recognition tags.</p><p>Obtain permissions when posting videos or images of others on your networks. Never take photos of patients during procedures without permission.</p><p>Scrub your accounts. Posting to social media leaves an imprint. Delete anything that’s irrelevant, embarrassing or disrespectful. That includes inactive accounts. If you don’t want the entire world to see you in a compromising position, delete it. Reflect seriously on what you post before you post it; if you wouldn’t want to see it on the front page of the newspaper, or you wouldn’t want your family to see it, do not post it. </p><p>Password diligence. Update passwords frequently. Keep an eye on any dormant accounts if you decide not to delete them. Inactive accounts are prone to hackers.</p><p>Spread love, not hate. Share uplifting or positive posts in support of causes, subjects and persons you care about. Refrain from giving legal advice or legal commentary</p><p>Do not post any comments, photos, videos, etc. that suggest or encourage illegal activity</p><p>Avoid violating any laws and regulations, including intellectual property (IP) rights and others regarding content that you send or receive</p><p>IP is divided into two categories:</p><p>Industrial Property – patents, trademarks and industrial designs</p><p>Copyright – includes works of art, literature, music and computer programs</p><p>Never transmit any material in any manner that is disruptive, threatening, profane, abusive, harassing, embarrassing, tortuous, defamatory, obscene, libelous or is an invasion of another’s privacy.</p><br />
