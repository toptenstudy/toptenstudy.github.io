She used the bank loan to purchase sewing machines. She also used some money for the construction of her tailoring shop. She bought sewing materials and supplies, which included: textiles, threads, zippers, buttons, scissors, and tailor chalk. She also hired 2 sewers. Charlotte did the following activities during the first year of operations of her business:- Define the target market.- Set sales targets- Set cost and expense targets- Set profit targets- Hire and train dressmakers.- Set compensation of dressmakers.- Set production quota for dressmakers.- Assign machines and supplies for each of the dressmaker.- Provide a commission scheme to sewers.-Coordinate activities of dressmakers.- Appraise performance of dressmakers to check alignment with organizational goals.For the first year, Charlotte was doing most of these tasks needed to deliver services to her customers, except for sewing. Her friend, Regina, helps her through advertising her services through Regina’s internet blogsite. Another friend, Vicky, helps her manage her financial records and books.The company’s performance for its first year of operations went beyond the expectation of Charlotte to at least break-even. The firm’s strong performance is mainly due to orders coming from Indo, Malay, Thai, and Singaporean mothers requesting for Charlotte to design and sew dresses for their 2 – to – 4 year old daughters.Guide Question:1.
