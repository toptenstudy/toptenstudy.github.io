                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first great “living” work of the Holy Spirit, the “Giver of Life,” is the Church. The word “Church” means “that which pertains to the Lord.” Therefore, the best way to introduce the Church’s nature and mission is to focus on Christ. “Christ is the light of all nations, and it is by proclaiming his Gospel to every creature that the light of Christ, which shines out visibly from the Church, may be brought to all men". For the Church is none other than that community of men and women “who, united in Christ, and guided by the Holy Spirit, press onwards towards the Kingdom of the Father and are bearers of a message of salvation intended for all men”.  </p><p> This chapter first takes up the Nature of the Church“what the Church is” as mystery and as sacrament.

These are what distinguishes the Church, its “marks” its being one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. What the Church is for and how it operates, its Mission and Ministry, are explained in the third part.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The covenants are crucial, </strong>as Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum have argued, because they are the backbone of the storyline of the Bible. The Bible isn’t a random collection of laws, moral principles, and stories. It is a story that goes somewhere; it is the story of redemption, the story of God’s kingdom. And the story unfolds and advances through the covenants God made with his people.</p><p>If we don’t understand the covenants, we will not and cannot understand the Bible because we won’t understand how the story fits together. The best way to see this is by quickly surveying the covenants in the Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>di ko po alam kung tama po </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everybody has their reasons for going to Mass. Here are my top 5.</p><p>1. What a wonderful way to start your day.</p><p>Ah, yes, the weekend is finally here. Friday and Saturday came and went, and inevitably, Sunday morning rolls around. If you’re like most Catholics, the thought of going to church is somewhere in your mind – even if it’s way far back there. You know you should go, that’s what a good Catholic would do. You want to be a good Catholic, you really do. But this is your day off, and you’re tired. And let’s be honest – the snooze button seems a lot more appealing.</p><p>Waking up for Mass in the morning can certainly be difficult. If that’s the main problem, there are evening Masses, but you probably already knew that. And if that’s not the only issue, surely you might come up with another excuse to skip. Your intentions are good, but you don’t follow through. This prevalent occurrence is a reality in today’s world. But, ladies and gentlemen, we can’t make excuses for God.</p><p>Catholics need to go to church, people. And don’t be a Chreaster, either. Chreasters are folks who show up to church only about twice a year … on Christmas and Easter. Don’t be one of those.</p><p>So, rise and shine. It really is the best way to start your Sunday.</p><p></p><p>2. Going to church weekly is good for you.</p><p>Studies have found that attending Mass is directly linked with enhancing your mood and improving your spiritual health. Supposedly it boosts the immune system and decreases blood pressure. It’s an opportunity to strengthen your faith.</p><p>Your faith is something to be proud of, and not only is it good for you, but you will feel good about yourself. Potentially, it will give you a sense of purpose. If you attend with your family, a closer bond may develop.</p><p>A new report from Gallup found that the happiest people are those who frequently go to a place of worship. And happiness, my friends, is crucial to our well-being. By doing this regularly, this enables the church to center and ground you. It will bring you the joy you crave, and the humility you need.</p><p>3. Whatever you are dealing with, religion is always part of the answer.</p><p>In our everyday lives, there are curve balls and ups and downs. Life is fair to no one. Attending church is a nice habit that will bless your life and produce positive results. It may help you understand what you are dealing with, or at least gain a better perspective. In tough times especially, you will find that attending church is full of benefits and only one outcome – a good one. It’s uplifting, motivating and inspiring. Simply put – practicing religion is good for your soul.</p><p>4. It is peaceful.</p><p>Mass can be a time of relaxation for you. A glorious hour of prayer and reflection can do wonders for your mind, body and spirit. It’s a time to listen, to give thanks, to forgive and to worship. Ultimately, this will bring you inner peace.</p><p>5. Gain relationships.</p><p>Going to church is not just that. Going to church means you become part of the parish family. It’s not something you do by yourself. It’s a reminder that you are not alone. You do this together, with other people, which will remind you that you have a supportive community by your side. These community members may become some of your closest friends. The people you see every Sunday will look for you to say hello. They will miss you if you aren’t there. They will keep you in their thoughts in prayers in a time of need. They will encourage and support you.</p><br />
