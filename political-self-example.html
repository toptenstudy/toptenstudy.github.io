                                            democracy is based on the majoruty principle. this is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rigths. at the same time, democracy also requires that the rigth of political and other minorities be safeguarded. the task at hand on will not be easy. but you have mandated us to change south africa from a country in which the majority lived witg little hope, to one in whicg they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. the cornerstone of building a better life of opportunitt, freedon and prosperity is the reconstruction and development programme. this needs unity of pupose. it needs in action. it requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. the people of south africa have spoken in these elections. they want change! and change is what they will get. our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all south africans. we will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. by encoyraging investors and the demicratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturinf will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. the goverment will devise policies that encourage and reward productive and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - african, coloured and indian. by easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroeds into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. while we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a goverment of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. we place our vision of a new constitutional order for south africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conqyered. we speak as fellow citizens to heak the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. this is the challenge that faces all south africans today, and it is one to which i am certain we will all rise. read another excerpt from mandela's speech, “the rainbow nation” and underline the emphasis markers used. an example is provided for you!Plssssss paki sagot po ng maayosunderline the emphasis markers used​</a>

Another example is, when you have plan to visit such place for vacation you must know first their culture for you to know what to do and not to do, like when you come to North Korea, you must prepare your self of the culture they have and you must also learn that their culture is further different from yours so you must be extra careful of what you're going to do there. </a>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations
C. Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees
D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees.

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.
