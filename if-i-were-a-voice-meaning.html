                                            Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</a>

A Day in the Bay Park by: Babylyn E. Calcetas One fine day while walking in the Bay Park, I saw fisher folks riding on a boat which I remember, mother told me they were the people who fish for a living along Lamon Bay area. My memory was so vivid or the photographic scene,still hanging on my mind, when my father travelled me around Lamon Bay within the boundaries of the town proper riding on a traditionally wooden hull fishing boat owned by our family. My father used to tell me stories about how they catch fish around Lamon Bay and even outside its boundary or end. I asked him" Father, who are you with while fishing outside Atimonan? Were you not scared of the big waves and inclement weather? For example, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness hits you and your boat." My father answered me with his sweet smile and said, "Daughter, I've been fishing since the day I met your mother. So, travelling the sea had been my life with the group of fervid people in fishing which your mother called people who are intensely passionate in fishing as their source of living. Until, I heard a voice calling my name from far and apart. " Lilang, come here, let's go home now. It's time to set the table for dinner." "Ah! he is my brother Roberto." I told myself. I left Bay Park before the sunset. It was indeed a great day for me. List the unfamiliar words or the highlighted words.

"To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

Excerpt from Twilight
By Stephenie Meyer
"You know Bella, Jacob?" Lauren asked—in what I imagined was an insolent tone—from across the fire.
"We've sort of known each other since I was born," he laughed, smiling at me again.
"How nice." She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed.
"Bella," she called again, watching my face carefully, "I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?" Her expression of concern was unconvincing.
"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep.
"Yes, do you know them?" she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him.
"The Cullens don't come here," he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question.
Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted.
I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something more—that they weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success.

If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</a>

As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die.

So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king. He was deeply impressed withTom's honesty and loyalty. Tom became King Edward's favorite and he gave him thetitle as The King's WardPA HELP PO PLEASE PASAHAN NA PO KASI NAMIN MAMAYA​</a>

                            8. Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</h2><br />

My father used to tell me stories about how they catch fish around Lamon Bay and even outside its boundary or end. I asked him" Father, who are you with while fishing outside Atimonan? Were you not scared of the big waves and inclement weather? For example, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness hits you and your boat." My father answered me with his sweet smile and said, "Daughter, I've been fishing since the day I met your mother. So, travelling the sea had been my life with the group of fervid people in fishing which your mother called people who are intensely passionate in fishing as their source of living. Until, I heard a voice calling my name from far and apart. " Lilang, come here, let's go home now. It's time to set the table for dinner." "Ah! he is my brother Roberto." I told myself.

"To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

Excerpt from Twilight
By Stephenie Meyer
"You know Bella, Jacob?" Lauren asked—in what I imagined was an insolent tone—from across the fire.
"We've sort of known each other since I was born," he laughed, smiling at me again.
"How nice." She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed.
"Bella," she called again, watching my face carefully, "I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?" Her expression of concern was unconvincing.
"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep.
"Yes, do you know them?" she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him.
"The Cullens don't come here," he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question.
Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted.
I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something more—that they weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success.

                            20. 1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The speaker describes his countrymen as worth dying for. An untapped resource. The Filipino men are described as free from constraints but are willing to surrender if it benefits his/her land. But, if they find injustice and abuse from the system, they would not be afraid to seek justice and peace.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2. The speaker regards himself as a Filipino who's forgiving, patient, and has good will. But most importantly, he regards himself as a Filipino who has a deep love for his country.</p><p></p><p>3. If I were to suffer and live the way the speaker has. I would show hostility rather than seek peace and forgiveness. It may make me sound bitter, but I still haven't reached the point in life where I can afford to give forgiveness to whoever has wronged me. But in the end, I applaud the speaker's action. He seeks justice not through violence, but with peace.</p><br />

He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king.
