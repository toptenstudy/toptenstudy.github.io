                                            DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1. What was the problem of the man in the story that you read?2. Why did the man decide to ask the advice of the rabbi?3.What advice was given to the depressed and unhappy man? What makes the anecdote humorous?​</a>

People have many varied reasons for protecting wildlife from extinction. One of these is economic. Some people think of the economic value of wildlife, such as the income that may be derived from rattan, orchids, and other forms of wildlife. There is also the need to find additional sources of food for the ever-increasing population. Another reason is artistic Artists and nature lovers think of the beauty of the different forms of wildlife. A third reason is genetic-based. People who study genetics think of the uniqueness of each species. Once the species become extinct, the peculiar combination of hundreds of characters will never be available again. A fourth reason is ecology-based. Ecologists think of the role played by the wildlife species in maintaining ecological balance. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forestlands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. More areas had to be cleared of trees to give more space for houses, schools, offices, roads, and other structures. As eir natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles, and other animals. Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them for our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspa- pers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rain water. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Read the paragraph. Circle the topic sentence, then copy the supporting​</a>

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</a>

                                            		Permit us to refresh your memory: what comes from heaven is always a blessing, the enemy is not the rain. Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</a>

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit. question?

                            11. DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1.

                            13. D. C. 15, 14. Read each paragraph. On your paper, identify and write the main idea of the paragraph and copy the key sentence. 13. People have many varied reasons for protecting wildlife from extinction. One of these is economic. Some people think of the economic value of wildlife, such as the income that may be derived from rattan, orchids, and other forms of wildlife. There is also the need to find additional sources of food for the ever-increasing population. Another reason is artistic Artists and nature lovers think of the beauty of the different forms of wildlife. A third reason is genetic-based. People who study genetics think of the uniqueness of each species. Once the species become extinct, the peculiar combination of hundreds of characters will never be available again. A fourth reason is ecology-based. Ecologists think of the role played by the wildlife species in maintaining ecological balance. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forestlands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. More areas had to be cleared of trees to give more space for houses, schools, offices, roads, and other structures. As eir natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles, and other animals. Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them for our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspa- pers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rain water. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Read the paragraph. Circle the topic sentence, then copy the supporting​</h2><br />

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</h2><br />

                            15. 		Permit us to refresh your memory: what comes from heaven is always a blessing, the enemy is not the rain. Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</h2><br />

This deductive paragraph generally discusses general statements with supporting sentences to clarify the statement. In other words, a deductive paragraph can be interpreted as a paragraph that starts with something general, then is given a supporting sentence, and ends with a special explanation or conclusion.</p><p><strong>If a deductive paragraph has the main idea in front or at the beginning</strong> of the paragraph, then an inductive paragraph is the opposite. That is, this inductive paragraph puts the main idea or main idea at the end of the paragraph. Meanwhile, the beginning of this inductive paragraph is filled with explanations or supporting sentences that clarify the topics discussed to get general conclusions first.</p><p>One of the challenges presented in writing inductive paragraphs is that the writer is required to be able to provide an overview that directs the reader to be able to read to the final conclusion. One of the requirements for writing inductive paragraphs is to write conjunctions or conjunctions so that each sentence can be interconnected or continuous. For example, as, therefore, because of that, therefore, thus, finally, and so on.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>More about inductive and deductive paragraphs</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/20595744</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                            30. this is the poem about dear city Permit us to refresh your memory: what comes from heaven is always a blessing, the enemy is not the rain. Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit. question?
