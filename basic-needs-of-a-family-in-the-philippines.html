                                            B. Road and understand the scenario given. Answer the questions provided.
Mario is known to be a helpful and approachable student who finished an engineering course in one of
the prestigious universities in the Philippines He loves to help his neighbors, classmates, friends, and those who
ever need his help. Because of his gesture, he was popular not just in school but also in their place. He found
pleasure in helping others that is why every time he can extend help, he feels happy. Mario came up with the plan
of putting up his own construction firm so he can apply his course and at the same time he can help others by
giving them a lower cost of engineering services as well as affordable construction supplies. With this plan, he will
be able to extend help again to those who have a tight budget in building their house, etc. It seems like Mario's
plan was tested during the onslaught of typhoon Odette in their hometown. After the storm, he sees how the
typhoon destructed the abode of the people. With this, most of the people suffered in terms of safety and security,
health issues, and even the supply of basic needs. Mario started to be confused on how he can extend help to the
people that even he and his family also needs help. If you are Mario, what will you do to come up with a good
business that you can apply your skills to and at the same time help the people in the community? What steps will
you apply to recognize the potential marketplace?</a>

                                            The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</a>

                            10. B. Road and understand the scenario given. Answer the questions provided.
Mario is known to be a helpful and approachable student who finished an engineering course in one of
the prestigious universities in the Philippines He loves to help his neighbors, classmates, friends, and those who
ever need his help. Because of his gesture, he was popular not just in school but also in their place. He found
pleasure in helping others that is why every time he can extend help, he feels happy. Mario came up with the plan
of putting up his own construction firm so he can apply his course and at the same time he can help others by
giving them a lower cost of engineering services as well as affordable construction supplies. With this plan, he will
be able to extend help again to those who have a tight budget in building their house, etc. It seems like Mario's
plan was tested during the onslaught of typhoon Odette in their hometown. After the storm, he sees how the
typhoon destructed the abode of the people. With this, most of the people suffered in terms of safety and security,
health issues, and even the supply of basic needs. Mario started to be confused on how he can extend help to the
people that even he and his family also needs help. If you are Mario, what will you do to come up with a good
business that you can apply your skills to and at the same time help the people in the community? What steps will
you apply to recognize the potential marketplace?</h2><br />

                            26. The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</h2><br />
