In fact, many peopleconsider Filipinos to be the Latin Americans of Asia due to their happy party spirit.Japanese think that Filipinos are great dancers and excellent at hosting or attendingparties, making every spot they go to an entertaining place where even the shiestperson can shine and have fun. Meanwhile, Japanese considers women from thePhilippines to be very beautiful, and it’s easy to see why. To make things moreimpressive, the Philippines has the longest streak of wins, meaning that the country’srecent climb to the top has been very fast. As a result of all this media exposure,many Japanese have become aware of how beautiful Filipinas are, making themthink of them as beauty queens. The Philippines also has so many beauty pageantsthat it could easily be considered a sport. On the other hand, it is perceived by theJapanese that Filipinos are also regarded as friends one can rely on since they are there to listen to you and support you. In difficult times when someone needs to leteverything out of their system, it’s considered that no one around you will trulyempathize with you like a Filipino will. That’s one of the many reasons Japanese likehaving their Filipino friends around! Furthermore, Japanese thinks, Filipinos have afantastic sense of community, which is why Japanese have found out howadvantageous it is to have good Filipino friends around. They can truly complementone’s life.</a>
