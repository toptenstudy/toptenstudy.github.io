All answers are correct.5. If an author writes on Taal Volcano Eruption and its aftermath, this  would be an example of which informational text pattern? A. Cause and Effect B. Comparison and contrast  C. Description D. Problem and solution6. Informational text that uses this structure simply describes something,  with few exceptions, this text also presents plenty of details about what  they describe. A.Problem/Solution B.Description C.Cause/Effect D.Compare/Contrast7. The text structures which explain well, causes and effects. The author  would likely also explain the causes and effects of the problem in order to  argue in favor of their solution. A. Problem/Solution B. Description C. Cause/Effect D. Compare/Contrast8.This text structure covers a few purposes: Sequential instructions (Step 1,  Step 2, Step 3; do this, then do that, and finally do this), Chronological  events (This happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc.) and  Arguments that use evidence to support a claim (presenting evidence from  least to most convincing). A. Problem/Solution B. Description C. Cause/Effect D. Sequence/Instruction/Process9. This text structure involves a comparison involving multiple things,  revealing how they are similar and how they are different. Comparisons  simply relay the differences; therefore, one thing could have both positive  and negative traits. A. Description B. Cause/Effect C. Compare/Contrast D. Sequence/Instruction/Process10.This text structure involves two parts in which the author identifies a  problem and details a solution to the problem. It can be a very complex  text structure, as it necessitates the use of other structures, too. Clearly,  the author needs to describe the problem. The author would likely also  explain the causes and effects of the problem in order to argue in favor of their solution.  A. Description B. Problem/Solution C. Compare/Contrast D.

The distance of epicenter from the station (km) The time difference in the arrival time of P-wave and S-wave (s) Recording station da BAGUIO 51.20 do BACOLOD 35.2 dc BUTUAN 54.4 Compute the distance of the epicenter from each of the stations using this formula: Ta d= x 100km 8s Where: d=distance (km) Ta= time difference in the arrival time of P-wave and S-wave (seconds) *note: This formula is suited because 8 seconds is the interval between the times of arrival of the P-wave and S-wave at a distance of 100 km. 1. What is the distance of epicenter from Baguio station? a. 640km b. 15.625 km C. 680 km d. 51.20 km 2.

Then pull the string tight, and tie it to another support in the room.  Blow up the balloon, and pinch the end of the balloon to keep the air inside. Do not tie the balloon.  Have a partner tape the balloon to the straw so that the opening of the balloon is horizontal with the ground, while you keep the air pinched inside the balloon. See the figure below.  Photo Credits: https://behrend.psu.edu/school-of-science/research-outreach/science-story- time/experiment-balloon-rocket  Predict what will happen to the balloon the moment you release it. Write your answers on the Prediction Phase of Table 1.  Have your partner use the marker to draw a finish line near the end of the string.
