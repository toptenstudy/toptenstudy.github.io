The Program is offered as a pre-requisite to graduation to Grade 11 and 12 students, aged 15–18, of DepEd public schools, private schools, state colleges and universities, and technical-vocational institutions. Due to the lack of knowledge, skills, and work experience that puts students at a disadvantage, as part of the programme, DepEd has made it a requirement for them to attain hands-on experience through work simulation of their chosen track to give them greater opportunities to apply their knowledge and capabilities. Participating students are trained, having close mentorship in their work environment with industry supervisors for a period of 80–320 hours during their two years of study. Learners cannot exceed eight working hours per day, anytime between 06.00-18.00 hours. To prepare for Work Immersion, learners have to take four specialized subjects where they can gain experience in a work environment related to their field of specialization. This aims to better equip senior high school students for college, work or business; develop life and career skills; and have attitudes, appreciation and respect for work. It also allows them to have a smooth transition from school to work after they gain valuable experience.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: i hope its help</strong></p><p></p><br />
