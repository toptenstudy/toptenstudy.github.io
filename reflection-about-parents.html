                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Norms are the spoken and unspoken rules of cultures. Reinforced over time, they operate as invisible constraints on family members’ behavior. Norms set standards for how family members dress, talk, and act. They also set limits on what is permissible or impermissible behavior under different circumstances and conditions. More than just rules of etiquette, norms provide family members with a guide for living both within the home and without.</p><p></p><p>When families establish foundations, they bring with them the rules of behavior that have governed the family culture. In 1985, John and Marianne Vanboven (not their real names) set up the Theodore Vanboven Family Foundation in honor of John’s father, a Dutch immigrant who built the family fortune. Originally, the board was composed of John and Marianne and their two children, Thomas and Alexandra. Then, two years, ago, the children’s spouses Joan and Michael, were added to the board.</p><p></p><p>The values of the family set the basic tone for the family foundation. They inspire the choice of mission as well as the foundation’s policies and practices. Typically, the values of the individuals who have created the family’s wealth predominate. Entrepreneurs with the single-mindedness and drive to amass fortunes often have powerful and compelling personalities to match. Not surprisingly, then, they shape foundations in their image and according to their values, philosophy, and preferred style of management—just as they did their business.</p><p></p><p>One such man was A. Lincoln Filene, who founded the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation in 1946. Born shortly after the assassination of President Lincoln, he was named by his immigrant parents in honor of the fallen president. Filene remained true to his namesake; throughout his life, he held progressive political views and acted on them.</p><p></p><p>Innovative businessman Lincoln Filene and his brother Edward built a major retail business, Filene’s department store in Boston, which had been started by their father. Later, Lincoln Filene joined with other store owners to form Federated Department Stores. The Filene brothers were the first to employ a full-time nurse in their store as an employee benefit in an era when most workers could not afford good medical care. They also promoted the creation of credit unions to help workers generate purchasing power.</p><p></p><p>Lincoln Filene was as engaged in the world as he was in his store. In the 1930s, he established programs for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany with the dual purpose of helping them get jobs and learn what it means to be an American. In the 1950s, he created the Filene Center for Civic Participation at Tufts University, and he also helped establish the first public broadcasting station in Boston.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years after the family foundation was founded, Filene’s social and political commitments still prevail. Lincoln Filene would be pleased that today, members of the third, fourth, and fifth generations of the family serve side by side on the board and on program committees carrying out the work he began on issues involving civic education, public broadcasting, and job training.</p><p></p><p>The values of entrepreneurs who have created their family’s wealth do not always inspire family members to follow in their footsteps. In some cases, they motivate them to take an opposite course. Charles Demeré, the founder of the Debley Foundation in St. Mary’s City, Maryland, is one who took a different path from that of his father and brothers.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The strikingly pretty child of an impoverished fishing family, Chiyo is taken to faraway Kyoto and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house where she is renamed Sayuri. Initially reluctant, Sayuri must finally invent and cultivate an image of herself as a desirable geisha in order to survive in Gion’s cruel hierarchy. Through her eyes, we are given a backstage view of the ancient and secretive geisha district, Gion, and of the lives of the women who learn and practice the rigorous arts of the geisha. Behind its facade of haunting beauty the district turns out to be a viciously competitive place where women vie desperately for men’s favor and largess, where a young girl’s virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder, where personal trust is almost nonexistent, and where no woman can afford even to dream about love or happiness. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>Good parenting is a wide idea, enveloping various parts of your and your youngster's coexistences. Good parenting is a collection of activities and connections that you have with your kid. It is driven considering reason and ultimate objectives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Good parenting additionally includes guardians carrying on with their lives as good examples. Kids pay attention to and watch what their folks do, taking everything in. As they ingest their folks' activities and words, they start to copy them. Good parenting implies staying alert that your kids are watching, learning, and replicating you. Since you've seen a portrayal of good parenting, we'll go a piece further into a good parenting definition. Good parenting centers around the general wellbeing and prosperity of children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Good parenting centers both around the present time and place of a youngster's life and on bringing up kids who are fruitful in their lives as they mature and become grown-ups. Keeping that in mind, good parenting approaches kids with adoration, warmth and acknowledgment. Sound parenting implies sustaining the entire youngster, taking care of physical, mental, social, passionate, and scholarly requirements.</strong></p><br />
