                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>THE ADVANTAGES OF LOYALTY CARDS FOR ANY SIZE BUSINESS</p><p>Posted on 4th May 2012 by Stamps Direct</p><p>Hand holding a selection of loyalty cards</p><p>Loyalty cards are a fantastic way to generate extra business and work well as a simple marketing tool to spread the word about your company.</p><p></p><p>The idea of loyalty cards is simple. When a customer visits your shop and makes a purchase, they get a stamp on their card. Several returns and purchases later, they can then redeem the card for a “reward” of goods or services. Many businesses find that loyalty card schemes increase sales through existing customers and attract new ones as well.</p><p></p><p>The following are other potential advantages of using loyalty cards as part of your business marketing.</p><p></p><p>ADVANTAGES OF LOYALTY CARDS</p><p>A loyalty card program is not only a good way to get new customers, it’s also a tried-and-trusted method of keeping them. The promise of a free reward for something you are going to buy anyway will win almost anyone over; so, the idea of a loyalty scheme is genius in its simplicity. As the business, offering a loyalty scheme ensures that that customers keeps coming back to you; instead of purchasing their daily coffee or sandwich from elsewhere!</p><p></p><p>INCREASE FREQUENT SALES</p><p>Loyalty card systems encourage customers to come back more often to take advantage of your special offers/discounts/rewards. The more the shop, the more they get in return. The good news is that you don’t have to offer a lot – whether a free cup of coffee, a free starter, or perhaps even a 10% discount off a specified purchase amount, these small offers can be all it takes to inspire a return visit.</p><p></p><p>INCREASED PRODUCT AWARENESS</p><p>Loyalty card schemes can be a great way to increase your product awareness. It might encourage customers to try something new by simply offering them the chance to get one for free. For example, if you ran a coffee shop, you could offer one of your tasty muffins for free with every 5 stamps (1 cup of coffee=1 stamp). Customers might love the muffins so much, they’ll purchase them next time they come in for a coffee. Changing the reward every now and then keeps things fresh and increases knowledge of your products.</p><p></p><p>INCREASED REACH</p><p>Loyal customers who enjoy your rewards might encourage their friends to join in. You could increase ‘recommendations’ by offering special discounts or extras for loyal customers. For example – recommend a friend and get an extra stamp on your card. The options are extremely variable, depending on your brand and product offering; get creative!</p><p></p><p>KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER</p><p>With a little bit of planning and analysis, you can learn more about your customers. Through your loyalty card scheme you can track and analyse your customers shopping habits and adjust your loyalty offers to match their needs. You can then adjust your marketing plan, in terms of trends, products, styles and more, to capitalise on this and increase your overall return.</p><p></p><p>CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND HAPPINESS</p><p>Loyalty card schemes are excellent for making a customer feel important and relevant. Once upon a time, if you offered a good service, customer loyalty was pretty much a given. Not anymore; with so much choice available to consumers now, both at physical shops and with the growth of online shopping and price comparison shopping at its height, customers no longer feel the need to stay with one brand. This is why you have to work harder to inspire your customers and encourage them to keep coming back – through consistent service that goes above and beyond, coupled with rewards. Customer happiness is important as it keeps them coming back for more and telling their friends and family.</p><p></p><p>If you’re thinking about running a loyalty card scheme, we have a range of loyalty card stamps and loyalty card embossing presses which can be used with your custom loyalty cards. These will help your business stand out and your card stand out from the rest in your customers’ wallet.</p><p></p><p>Stamps Direct not only have a vast range of traditional rubber stamps, we have the expertise to create bespoke stamps to suit you and your requirements.</p><br />
