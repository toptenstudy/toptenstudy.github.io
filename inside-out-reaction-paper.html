But her happiness has faded when COVID - 19 pandemic affected everybody’s normal way of life in their place. Althea missed her friends, teachers, and classmates. 	One afternoon after lunch, while Althea and her parents were watching TV, she said, “Ma, I am bored staying inside our house for many months, can I go out and play with friends now?” Her mother explained that little children are not allowed to go out because they are more vulnerable to infection like COVID - 19. 	Althea willingly obeyed her mother because she knew that her mother only wanted what is best for her.REACTION PAPERIn (14)___________________ Story“Obedience” is a story that(15) ________________________________________________________________________________________________.It is all about (16)____________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________This story (17)______________________________________________ _______________________________________________________.

                                            Box Full of Kisses Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.

Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.
