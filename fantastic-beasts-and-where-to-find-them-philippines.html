                            26. Long ago, the birds and the beasts had a quarrel. The birds gathered at the 
 owl’s home in the forest. “Let us make war on the beasts,” said the owl. “Yes, let us 
make war,” replied the other birds. “You shall be our captain.” Then the owl led the 
way and they all followed. As they passed the tree where the bat was hanging, they 
 passed the tree where the bat was hanging, they
said, “Come with us.” But the bat answered, “Don’t you see that I am a beast?” Then
some beasts walking beneath the tree said to him, “Won’t you come with us?” The
bat answered. “Don’t you see that I am a bird?” However, the bat followed the beasts
for a short distance. Then he hung himself up in a tall tree and watched the battle.
When he thought that the birds were sure to win, he flew to join them.
“I have come to help you,” he said. “We don’t want you,” said the birds. “You
are a beast.” “Oh, no! I am a bird.” replied the bat. “Look at my wings.” Later when
the beasts seemed to be gaining, he went to join them. “I have come to help you,” he

are a bird.” “Oh no! I am not a bird,” replied the bat. “Look at my feet and my sharp
teeth.” At last the birds and the beasts made a peace treaty. They will not fight
anymore. The bat went to the birds and said, “I wish to be a friend with you.” But
the birds cried out anger, “go away. You are not a bird.” He then went to the beasts.
“Please let me be your friend,” he said. But the beast shouted at him; “Go away. You
are not a beast.” “Ah,” said the bat. “I see that I must live alone. He that is neither
bird nor beast has no friends.” Since that day, the bat has hidden in dark places. He
flies only at night when both birds and beasts are sleeping.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang salitang "fantastic" ay nagmula sa salitang Latin na "fantasticus" na nangangahulugang "imaginative" o "fantastical." Sa kasalukuyang panahon, ang salitang "fantastic" ay karaniwang ginagamit upang magpahayag ng kahanga-hanga, kamangha-mangha, o kahindik-hindik na mga pangyayari, konsepto, o bagay.</p><p></p><p>Ang mga advantages ng paggamit ng salitang "fantastic" ay kasama ang pagbibigay ng pambihirang o masayahing kahulugan sa isang bagay o pangyayari. Ito rin ay maaaring magdagdag ng tibay ng damdamin o malikhaing halimbawa sa mga akda o pagpapahayag ng mga ideya.</p><p></p><p>Ang mga disadvantage ng paggamit ng salitang "fantastic" ay maaaring magbigay ng hindi malinaw na kahulugan, at maaaring magdulot ng sobrang-pagpapahalaga sa mga bagay o pangyayari. Dahil dito, maaaring magdulot ito ng hindi tamang pagpapahalaga sa mga bagay o pangyayari na hindi naman talaga dapat ipinagmamalaki o pinapahalagahan.</p><p></p><p>Halimbawa ng paggamit ng salitang "fantastic" ay:</p><p></p><p>•"The performance of the artist was fantastic!"</p><p>•"The view from the top of the mountain was absolutely fantastic!"</p><p>•"The new gadget is fantastic, it's so advanced and user-friendly!"</p><br />
