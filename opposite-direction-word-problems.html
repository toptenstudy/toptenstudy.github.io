Look and encircle for signal words that showAstronauts face many challenges in space caused by weightlessness. One of theseobstacles is floating around the cabin. To solve thisproblem, astronauts wear shoes that arecoated with a special adhesive. This adhesive sticks to the floor of the cabin. Serving food isanother problem. It will not stay put on the table! Experts overcame this problem by puttingfood and drinks in pouches and tubes. It only needs to be mixed with water. Weightlessnessalso causes problems when an astronaut tries to work. The simple task of turning a wrenchor a doorknob can be difficult. Since there is no gravity to keep him down, when he exerts aforce in one direction, the opposite force may flip him over completely. To solve his problem,he must be very careful about how much force he uses to do these simple tasks. Here onearth, life is much simpler, thanks to gravity.1.

momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.

Look and encircle for signal words that show problem-solution.Then,answer the question that follow .Astronauts face many challenges in space caused by weightlessness. One of these obstacles is floating around the cabin. To solve this problem, astronauts wear shoes that are coated with a special adhesive. This adhesive sticks to the floor of the cabin. Serving food is another problem. It will not stay put on the table! Experts overcame this problem by putting food and drinks in pouches and tubes. It only needs to be mixed with water. Weightlessness also causes problems when an astronaut tries to work. The simple task of turning a wrench or a doorknob can be difficult. Since there is no gravity to keep him down, when he exerts a force in one direction, the opposite force may flip him over completely. To solve his problem, he must be very careful about how much force he uses to do these simple tasks. Here on earth, life is much simpler, thanks to gravity.1.

Experts overcame this problem by puttingfood and drinks in pouches and tubes. It only needs to be mixed with water. Weightlessnessalso causes problems when an astronaut tries to work. The simple task of turning a wrenchor a doorknob can be difficult. Since there is no gravity to keep him down, when he exerts aforce in one direction, the opposite force may flip him over completely. To solve his problem,he must be very careful about how much force he uses to do these simple tasks. Here onearth, life is much simpler, thanks to gravity.1.

(Hint: Use acceleration due to gravity as your acceleration. Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Earth is 9.8 m/s² while acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the moon is 1.62 m/s².) 7. A fireworks shell is accelerated from rest to a velocity of 65.0m/s over a distance of 250 m. (a) Calculate the acceleration. (b) How long did the acceleration last?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.(a) The total distance travelled by the procession is the sum of the distances travelled in each direction. The procession travels 50 m north, 40 m east, 60 m north, and 50 m south, for a total of 200 m. It also travels 40 m west and 60 m south, for a total of 100 m. Therefore, the total distance travelled is 200 m + 100 m = 300 m.</p><p>(b) The total displacement of the procession is the distance and direction from the starting point to the ending point. The starting point is at the school, and the ending point is at the school, so the total displacement is 0 m.</p><p></p><p>2. (a) The total distance travelled by Maria and Angelito is 360 m, and the time taken is 10 s + 360 m / 3.0 m/s = 120 s. Therefore, the average speed of Maria and Angelito is 360 m / 120 s = 3.0 m/s.</p><p>(b) Maria reaches the school at t = 360 m / 3.0 m/s = 120 s, and Angelito reaches the school at t = 360 m / 4.0 m/s = 90 s. Therefore, Angelito reaches the school first.</p><p></p><p>3. (a) If the lady is standing still, the time taken to reach the other end of the moving sidewalk is 50.0 m / 1.25 m/s = 40.0 s.</p><p>(b) If the lady walks at 1.50 m/s relative to the moving sidewalk, the time taken to reach the other end of the sidewalk is 50.0 m / (1.25 m/s + 1.50 m/s) = 25.0 s.</p><p></p><p>4. The acceleration of Pedro's car is 15 m/s - 6.0 m/s / 4.5 s = 2.0 m/s². The distance travelled during the acceleration can be calculated using the formula:</p><p></p><p>d = vt + 0.5at^2</p><p></p><p>5. Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the distance travelled is:</p><p></p><p>d = 6.0 m/s * 4.5 s + 0.5 * 2.0 m/s² * (4.5 s)^2</p><p></p><p>= 27 m + 40.5 m</p><p></p><p>= 67.5 m</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total distance travelled by Pedro is 67.5 m.</p><p></p><p>6. The force acting on a body is equal to the mass of the body multiplied by its acceleration. Therefore, the force acting on the 5.0 kg body is 5.0 kg * 2.5 m/s² = 12.5 N.</p><p></p><p>(a) The mass of the astronaut on Earth is given by the formula:</p><p></p><p>m = F/a</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the mass of the astronaut on Earth is:</p><p></p><p>m = 931 N / 9.8 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 95.3 kg</p><p></p><p>(b) The mass of the astronaut on the moon can be calculated using the same formula, with the acceleration due to gravity on the moon:</p><p></p><p>m = 931 N / 1.62 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 573 kg</p><p></p><p>(c) The weight of the astronaut on the surface of the moon can be calculated using the formula:</p><p></p><p>F = ma</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the weight of the astronaut on the moon is:</p><p></p><p>F = 573 kg * 1.62 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 931 N</p><p></p><p>7.

Nahihirapan po ako Pasagot na po ipapasa ko na po Ito mamaya​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>For the first problem, the truck travels 2.5 km to the east to reach the quarry, and then it travels the same distance (2.5 km) back to the starting point. The total distance traveled by the truck is 2.5 km + 2.5 km = 5 km. The displacement of the truck is 0 km, because the truck returns to its starting point and has not changed its position with respect to a fixed reference point. A diagram of this situation might show the truck moving 2.5 km to the right (east) and then 2.5 km to the left (west), with the truck returning to its original starting point.</p><p></p><p>For the second problem, the whale swims 7 km due east, turns around and goes 2 km due west, and then turns around again and heads 4 km due west. The total distance traveled by the whale is 7 km + 2 km + 4 km = 13 km. The displacement of the whale is 4 km west, because this is the final change in position with respect to a fixed reference point. A diagram of this situation might show the whale starting at the origin, moving 7 km to the right (east), then 2 km to the left (west), and finally 4 km to the left (west), with the whale ending up 4 km to the left of the starting point.</p><p></p><p>For the third problem, The total distance traveled by the coach is the sum of all the distances between the different positions. It would be helpful to draw a line connecting all position A to B, B to C and so on, that would help to measure the coach distance traveled. The coach's final displacement is the change in position with respect to a fixed reference point. It could be measured by the distance between the initial position A and final position D. The answers to these two questions depend on the specific distances between the different positions in the diagram you have provided, which is not available.</p><p></p><p>Please let me know if you have any other question.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration

Her son was in the 10th grade while her daughter, who was a year younger than
her son was in the 9th grade. The two children used to help her in doing household
chores. They were (2) diligent and obedient. However, when her son became a
member of a (3) fraternity, his behavior and attitude changed.
The son was always with his group mates. He loved hanging out with them.
Eventually, he became (4) negligent and (5) impolite which (6) reflected the kind of
people he always spent time with. More often than not, the mother cried for her son's
(7) rudeness and bad attitude.
However, she was very (8) grateful for her daughter, the exact opposite of her
son, and who was always by her side. Her daughter was the only one who would (9)

Look and encircle for signal words that show problem-solution.Then,answer the question that follow .Astronauts face many challenges in space caused by weightlessness. One of these obstacles is floating around the cabin. To solve this problem, astronauts wear shoes that are coated with a special adhesive. This adhesive sticks to the floor of the cabin. Serving food is another problem. It will not stay put on the table! Experts overcame this problem by putting food and drinks in pouches and tubes. It only needs to be mixed with water. Weightlessness also causes problems when an astronaut tries to work. The simple task of turning a wrench or a doorknob can be difficult. Since there is no gravity to keep him down, when he exerts a force in one direction, the opposite force may flip him over completely. To solve his problem, he must be very careful about how much force he uses to do these simple tasks. Here on earth, life is much simpler, thanks to gravity.1.
