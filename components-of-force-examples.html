                                            l-Related Physical Fitness 1. Agility - is the ability to change and control the direction and position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid motion; for example, changing directions to hit a tennis ball. 2. Balance - is the ability to control or stabilize the body when a person is standing still or moving; for example, in-line skating. 3. Coordination - is the ability to use the senses together with body parts during movement; for example, dribbling a basketball. Using hands and eyes together is called hand-eye coordination. 4. Speed - is the ability to move your body or parts of your body swiftly. Many sports rely on speed to gain advantage over your opponents; for example, a basketball player making a fast break to perform a lay-up, a tennis player moving forward to get to a drop shot, and a football player outrunning the defense to receive a pass. 5. Power - is the ability to move the body parts swiftly while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power is a combination of both speed and muscular strength; for example, fullbacks in football muscling their way through other players and speeding to advance the ball and volleyball players getting up to the net and lifting their bodies high into the air.6. Reaction Time - is the ability to reach or respond quickly to what you hear, see, or feel; for example, an athlete quickly coming off the blocks early in a swimming or track relay, or stealing a base in baseball. ACTIVITIESAnswer the following questions below.1. Why do athletes or athletic individuals need skill-related fitness? ___________________________________________________2. Can others, besides athletes, benefit from skill-related fitness? Why? ___________________________________________________1.

Physical activity can reduce your risk of chronic disease, improve your balance and coordination, help you lose weight — and even improve your sleep habits and self-esteem. And there's more good news. You can start a fitness program in only five steps.</p><p></p><strong>Assess your fitness level. </strong>You must know how fit you are by examining your heart rate and pulse rate. You can take a small walk to check how easily you get exhausted. Check your body mass index. <strong>Design your fitness program. </strong>With the help of an expert, you can go ahead and ask for recommendations about the best types of exercises accurate for your body type and fitness level.<strong>Assemble your equipment. </strong>Set up your materials and equipment that will help you with your goal. Be sure to pick types of equipment designed for your needs.<strong>Get started. </strong>Do not just plan. Start right away. Start slowly and build up gradually. Listen to your body and be flexible.<strong>Monitor your progress. </strong>To check how effective your plan is, the best way to see this is by monitoring daily. Retake your personal fitness assessment six weeks after you start your program and then again every few months. You may notice that you need to increase the amount of time you exercise in order to continue improving.<p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>For more information, please visit https://brainly.ph/question/13840373.</p><br />

                            23. l-Related Physical Fitness 1. Agility - is the ability to change and control the direction and position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid motion; for example, changing directions to hit a tennis ball. 2. Balance - is the ability to control or stabilize the body when a person is standing still or moving; for example, in-line skating. 3. Coordination - is the ability to use the senses together with body parts during movement; for example, dribbling a basketball. Using hands and eyes together is called hand-eye coordination. 4. Speed - is the ability to move your body or parts of your body swiftly. Many sports rely on speed to gain advantage over your opponents; for example, a basketball player making a fast break to perform a lay-up, a tennis player moving forward to get to a drop shot, and a football player outrunning the defense to receive a pass. 5. Power - is the ability to move the body parts swiftly while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power is a combination of both speed and muscular strength; for example, fullbacks in football muscling their way through other players and speeding to advance the ball and volleyball players getting up to the net and lifting their bodies high into the air.6. Reaction Time - is the ability to reach or respond quickly to what you hear, see, or feel; for example, an athlete quickly coming off the blocks early in a swimming or track relay, or stealing a base in baseball.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Why do athletes or athletic individuals need skill-related fitness?</p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>Athletes need to be fast, be able to change directions, have good balance, and all the other skills to be able to compete and be the best they can.</strong></p><p>2. Can others, besides athletes, benefit from skill-related fitness? Why?<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-Yes, people besides athletes can benefit from skill-related fitness. Skill related fitness training or exercises can increase the coordination, energy ,reaction time, balance and agility of individuals at large, leading to an increased in ability to complete routine workplace tasks.</strong></p><p>3. Do you think that skill-related fitness could also be a health-related fitness  component? Explain.</p><p><strong>-Health-related fitness is characterized by moderate to vigorous physical activity.Skill-related fitness is the right choice for people who can and want to perform at a high level, but it is less acceptable to most people because it requires training and exercising at high intensities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Sana po nakatulong :D</strong></p><br />
