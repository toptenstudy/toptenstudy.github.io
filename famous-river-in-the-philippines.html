The Islands of Paradise By: Richard Gula The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation's center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government's national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and Masskara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the "king of the fruits" which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. Guide Questions: 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines? 2. What are the three island groups in the Philippines? 3. What makes Luzon the economic and political center of the country? 4. What makes the Visayas unique from Luzon and Mindanao? Summary: </a>

It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines?

These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense.

Moreover, it is also famous for a couple of adventures such as crossing the river via a bamboo raft or through a hanging bridge and diving from the cliffs for those who like a little more extreme experience.However, it also has its shares of mystery to tell over the years. Notwithstanding her unquestionable beauty that attracts visitors; countless incidences of drowning have been recorded and became the talk of the town, spreading even up to its neighboring towns within the province. People believed that the river is taking lives every year for the river is inhabited also by unseen elements who are not of this world. According to hearsays, the river is possessed by some sort of evil spirits. Thus, everyone who wishes to visit the place must be cautious not to disturb these unseen entities for it might cost the sightseer his own life. A mystery that those who love thrill and adventure combined cannot resist exploring and experiencing for themselves.Fact:________________Opinion:_______________Fallacy:_________________pahelp po bukas na po yung pasahan​</h2><br />

It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines.
