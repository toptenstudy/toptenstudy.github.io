In a deeper sense,human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company ofothers to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness canbe found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also,people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectivesin life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, familybackground and other personal qualities.

Everything in this worldinvolves workIn what light should work be viewed? Anythingthat comes from something done is achieved bymeans of labor and work. It is of two-fold nature,either mental or physical. Both are indispensable tothe well-being of human society. Our attention isdirected towards physical labor.Christianity teaches us to regard work assomething sacred and honorable Work is duty. Youmust not only work highly, you must also love itheartily. Without it, order and cleanliness can neverexist in the house. State of affairs would be a messand discomfort prevails.People who work and are kept busy have notime for hanging around, gossiping, or being withbad company. Women who are fond of work aremore virtuous and pure. There is no dull moment intheir lives, there is so much to gain when they arephysically preoccupied.Be proud, therefore, and love your work. Do itdiligently and make your best. Treat it as aninseparable friend. Whatever the nature of yourwork may be, do it with care and industry. If it is adomestic chore, do not find fault and make criticalremarks, but put your hand to everything.If your work is to be really done well, if it is togain merit for yourself, perform it with goodintention. Yes, be patient, for without patience, nolabor, no toil or work can be meritorious in the eyesof Someone above.These lines speak well of this:Swiftly time speeds on its waySee that thou use it wellLet each hour of everydayBe a tale of wisdom to tell. read,analyze and summarize the text provided below. need it ASAP! ​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others.

Then, answer the questions that followThe Value of WorkEverything has value no matter howsignificant or simple it is.At the mere mention of work, one immediately connects with it the idea of toil and fatigue which pertains to a slave who overdoes things in a difficult manner. Everything in this world involves work.In what light should work be viewed? Anything that comes from something done is achieved by means of labor and work. It is of two-fold nature, either mental or physical. Both are indispensable to the well-being of human society. Our attention is directed towards physical labor.Christianity teaches us to regard work as something sacred and honorable Work is duty. You must not only work highly, you must also love it heartly. Without it, order and cleanliness can never exist in the house. State of affairs would be a mess and discomfort prevailsPeople who work and are kept busy have no time for hanging around, gossiping, or being with bad company. Women who are fond of work are more virtuous and pure. There is no dull moment in their lives, there is so much to gain when they are physically preoccupied.Be proud, therefore, and love your work. Do it diligently and make your best. Treat it as an inseparable friend. Whatever the nature of your work may be, do it with care and industry. If it is a domestic chore, do not find fault and make critical remarks, but put your hand to everything.If your work is to be really done well, if it is to gain merit for yourself, perform it with good intention. Yes, be patient, for without patience, no labor, no toil or work can be meritorious in the eyes of Someone above.----------------------------------------------These lines speak well of this: Swiftly time speeds on its way See that thou use it well.

                            18. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.
