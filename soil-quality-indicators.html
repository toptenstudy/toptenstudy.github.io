                        <p><strong>A</strong><strong>nswer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Scientists use soil quality indicators to evaluate how well soil functions since soil function often cannot be directly measured. Measuring soil quality is an exercise in identifying soil properties that are responsive to management, affect or correlate with environmental outcomes, and are capable of being precisely measured within certain technical and economic constraints. Soil quality indicators may be qualitative (e.g. drainage is fast) or quantitative (infiltration= 2.5 in/hr).</p><p></p><p>There are three main categories of soil indicators: chemical, physical and biological. Typical soil tests only look at chemical indicators. Soil quality attempts to integrate all three types of indicators. The categories do not neatly align with the various soil functions, so integration is necessary. The table below shows the relationship between indicator type and soil function.</p><p></p><p>Organic matter, or more specifically soil carbon, transcends all three indicator categories and has the most widely recognized influence on soil quality. Organic matter is tied to all soil functions. It affects other indicators, such as aggregate stability (physical), nutrient retention and availability (chemical), and nutrient cycling (biological); and is itself an indicator of soil quality.</p><p></p><p>Chemical indicators can give you information about the equilibrium between soil solution (soil water and nutrients) and exchange sites (clay particles, organic matter); plant health; the nutritional requirements of plant and soil animal communities; and levels of soil contaminants and their availability for uptake by animals and plants. Indicators include measures of:</p><p></p>Electrical conductivitySoil nitrateSoil reaction<p></p><p>Biological indicators can tell us about the organisms that form the soil food web that are responsible for decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling. Information about the numbers of organisms, both individuals and species, that perform similar jobs or niches, can indicate a soil's ability to function or bounce back after disturbance (resistance and resilience).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Soil, water, air, and plants are vital natural resources that help to produce food and fiber for humans. They also maintain the ecosystems on which all life on Earth ultimately depends. Soil serves as a medium for plant growth; a sink for heat, water, and chemicals; a filter for water; and a biological medium for the breakdown of wastes. Soil interacts intimately with water, air, and plants and acts as a damper to fluctuations in the environment. Soil mediates many of the ecological processes that control water and air quality and that promote plant growth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.</p><p>a.Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is. Monitoring air quality is important because polluted air can be bad for our health—and the health of the environment. Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The AQI works sort of like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees.</p><p></p><p>b.Water quality describes the condition of the water, including chemical, physical, and biological characteristics, usually with respect to its suitability for a particular purpose such as drinking or swimming. ... Poor water quality can also pose a health risk for ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>c.Soil quality is a measure of the condition of soil relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purpose. </p><p></p><p>2.</p><p>A.Poor air quality can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, cause shortness of breath, aggravate asthma and other respiratory conditions, and affect the heart and cardiovascular system. Breathing polluted air for long periods of time can cause more serious problems.</p><p></p><p>B.water pollution is the effect it has on aquatic life. Dead fish, birds, dolphins, and many other animals often wind up on beaches, killed by pollutants in their habitat. Pollution disrupts the natural food chain as well. Pollutants such as lead and cadmium are eaten by tiny animals.</p><p></p><p>C.The quality of a soil is determined by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological properties such as texture, water-holding capacity, porosity, organic matter content, and depth. Since these attributes differ among soils, soils differ in their quality.</p><p></p><p>3.</p><p>A.Short- and/or long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with a wide range of human health effects including increased respiratory symptoms, hospitalization for heart or lung diseases, and even premature death.</p><p></p><p>B.Bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases like typhoid, cholera, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis, skin infection and gastrointestinal are spreading through polluted water. It is recommended to examine the water quality on regular basis to avoid its destructive effects on human health.</p><p></p><p>C.Ingested soil can potentially supply essential nutrients, but it can also lead to exposure to heavy metals, organic chemicals or pathogens and in large amounts can cause an intestinal obstruction (Henry &amp; Cring, 2013). Respiration involves inhaling soil materials.</p><br />
