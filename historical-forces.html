                                            On February 28, the 2021 Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States was released. The report revealed that dozens of workers had been trafficked to American farms for forced labor. For the United States, forced labor is an indelible stain on its history. Black slaves, Chinese laborers, child laborers and prisoners in private prisons were all subjects of forced labor in the United States, and were exploited and abused in different historical periods. With its own history, the United States has proved to the world that "forced labor" is the best hat to wear on its own.</a>

The <strong>moro-moro</strong> is the re-enactment of the Filipinos struggle against the Spanish invaders. <strong>Arnis</strong>, the derivative of the harnes ( colorful Spanish costumes) has become the name of the martial arts which was used to be Kali.​</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Arnis is a martial art that originated in the Philippines. Kali, an ancient Malayan word that refers to a large bladed weapon longer than a knife, was the name given to it in the ancient Philippines. The pre-Spanish Filipinos, who were known for their warm demeanor and renowned hospitality, used this art largely for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>Hand-to-hand combat has always been a part of the Filipino culture throughout their long, violent, and deadly history. He became an expert at fighting with his hands, either bare or with a stick and a bladed weapon, out of necessity and self-preservation. The early Filipinos were already a fighting people employing the bow and arrow or the longbow before the bladed weapon was introduced. The prehistoric Negritos, coming from Central Asia during prehistoric times, were experts in these weapons.</p><p></p><p>Arnis de mano is the best known and the most systematic fighting art in the Philippines. It is a perfected art after a long historical development from the kali systems designed to train the student to defend himself against armed or unarmed attacks. Arnis, as it is commonly called, has also been known in other dialects as estacada among the Tagalog provinces and estoque or fraile in other regions.
</p><p>
</p><p>As a fighting art, Arnis has three forms of play. They are the espada y daga ("sword and dagger") in which a long wooden sword and a short wooden dagger is used; the solo baston (single stick) in a single long muton or baston (wooden stick or rattan cane hardened by drying or heating) is used; and the sinawali, a native term applied because the intricate movements of the two muton resemble the weave of a sawali (criss-cross fashion), the bamboo splits weave pattern used in walling and matting.
