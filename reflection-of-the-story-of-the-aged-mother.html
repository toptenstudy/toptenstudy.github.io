                                            As happens in most families, the oldest children are put in charge of theyoungest. While Frank acts as the self-assumed leader of the family, thechildren recognize that their mother Lillian, who also works professionallyas a psychologist, is the driving force behind the family. Mother neverthreatened, never shouted or became excited, never spanked a single oneof her children or anyone else. As the children grow, they are taught tobehave differently from children in smaller households. For example, theyall have to come running when the father whistles. While this might seemautocratic, Frank made it a game and to place them quietly upon assembly.Schooling is also emphasized, both in the home and in educationalinstitutions. Frank is very creative in ways he can help his children learnabout the world from a very young age. He is always pushing the childrento advance academically, staying ahead of their peers Frank does this bysurrounding the children with educational games and by creating learningopportunities for them. He is also very involved in their school life, evengoing in to sit in on dasses unexpectedly.1. What does the story tells you?2. Reflect on how the Gilbreth family runs their household.​</a>
