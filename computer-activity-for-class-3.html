                                            TRUE OR FALSE QUESTION (Bigay kita malaking Rank makasagot ng maayos) 1. Selection: One of two blocks of program code is executed based on a test for some condition2. The first Generation (1945 - 1955) - Very large computers made up of vacuum tubes and often programmed using wiring plugboards3. BooleanBoolean data types hold either a true or a false value. These are not stored as numeric values and cannot be used as such.4. A class is a template for holding an object. An object as such is a logical entity which means it is in the definition level, where as a class realizes the object. A group of objects can be called as a class of objects5. Sequence: Statements are executed one after another6. An object is an item that can contain both data and activities that read or manipulate the data. The object in Object oriented programming is the same as the real world objects7. Iteration: One or more statements are executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true8. A program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer in order to do a specific task. To write a program we need a language. Programming languages have evolved tremendously since early 1950's and this evolution has resulted in over hundreds of different languages being invented and used in the industry9. Micro Computer: They are called desktop computers. They are used for intensive calculations e.g. laptop computers, note book, hand-held computer, Palm top computer 10. A computer is an electronic machine, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data as input, manipulate the data according to specified rules and produces the result as output. ​</a>
