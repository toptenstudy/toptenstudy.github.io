                        <p><strong>Answer:The choice to live a healthier lifestyle is usually made during one's youth, with sports, visits to the gym, and a generally active lifestyle leading to improved health. With obesity on the rise throughout most developed nations like United Kingdom and America, as the combination of junk food and stationary visual media creates a generation of people adverse to physical activity, the need to raise awareness about healthy living has never been greater. For members of my generation, who are in their late thirties or early forties, there are many legitimate reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Unlike most other activities in life, exercising, and eating nutritionally balanced diet present a positive choice with clear advantages and no drawbacks. When you are physically fit as an adult, the benefits also extend to your emotional well being, providing a constructive outlet for negative feelings to be released in a constructive environment. Healthy living can also provide tremendous financial benefits, in the form of savings on groceries or the reduced likelihood of medical expenses, which is especially enticing considering the current economic climate. The following reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle present the argument that eating right and exercising regularly are choices you simply can't afford to neglect.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Mental health refers to a person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; it influences what they feel and how they think, and behave. The state of cognitive and behavioural well-being is referred to as mental health. The term 'mental health' is also used to refer to the absence of mental disease. </p><p>Mental health means keeping our minds healthy. Mankind generally is more focused on keeping their physical body healthy. People tend to ignore the state of their minds. Human superiority over other animals lies in his superior mind. Man has been able to control life due to his highly developed brain. So, it becomes very important for a man to keep both his body and mind fit and healthy.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>      Dance benefits us in many ways. </p><p>Physically, mentally and socially. </p><p>Physically dance benefits us </p><p>by giving me an exercise, </p><p>improving my health, </p><p>and creating superfluidity in the brain.</p><p>Mentally dance creates a creative</p><p>outlet and it can reduce stress, anxiety,</p><p>and depression.

YUNG MAAYOS NA SAGOT GUYS (づ-̩̩̩-̩̩̩_-̩̩̩-̩̩̩)づ</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I were given a chance to become a writer on a health magazine, the article that I would make would focus on the current health issue of the government not only here in the Philippines but also worldwide. My article would have the title "Prevention is always better than cure".  </p><p></p><p>Prevention is Always Better Than Cure</p><p>"It's never too late, the government is just over-reacting the situation" - these were the words that people keep on uttering nationwide, not just through their mouth but also through their social media accounts. Since the Philippine government has decided to lock down affected places especially in Luzon, just like what has expected, negative reactions were the judgment of the people from the current situation.  </p><p>But how does this virus spread out? One of the possible causes that they've been looking at was the personal hygiene of each person that affects their immune system. Cleanliness is what everyone needs to improve especially on their personal hygiene. Always cleaning the hands through the use of soaps and alcohol can lessen the bacteria found. The said virus can be transferred from one person to another through physical contact. Taking the right amount of vitamins may also provide protection and can increase the built of the immune system...</p><p><br />:&gt;  Pa Brainliest po</p><br />

                            16. GOAL: Persuade students in your school to follow safety protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. ROLE: You are the president of the student council.AUDIENCE: Online school community SITUATION: The number of cases infected by COVID-19 in your province has not yet reduced recently.

                            17. Imagine that you are writer's in health magazine. Write a persuasive essay that talks about health awareness. On article that points out bad health habits and way to change them​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quit smoking. Lay off the junk food. Stop being lazy. Don’t stay up too late. All of that sounds simple enough, but simply doesn’t always mean easy. You’ll need a good strategy to break some of those bad habits. Knowing you need to change something usually isn’t enough motivation to do it. You may even think there’s a good reason you do it.</p><p></p><p>For example, sometimes people who smoke feel like smoke breaks are the only times they can step away from their work during the day. And eating together is a way to bond with friends and family, so you may go along with the crowd instead of choosing healthier foods.</p><p></p><p>But are those really good reasons? You can take a break and go outside without smoking. You can enjoy a meal with friends and make better food choices.</p><p></p><p>A good way to get yourself going is to figure out what benefits you’ll get when you change your habits:</p><p></p><p>You’ll feel better when you take care of your health.</p><p>Your chances of certain diseases and conditions may go down.</p><p>More activity and better foods can help you lose a few pounds and feel more comfortable in your clothes.</p><br />
