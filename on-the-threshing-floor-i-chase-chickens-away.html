                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> EXPLAIN</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"On the Threshing Floor, I Chase the Chickens Away" is a poem by Chinese poet Yu Xiuhua that explores the theme of loneliness and isolation. In the poem, the speaker describes their experience of chasing away chickens on a threshing floor, a place where grains are separated from their husks. The speaker's actions are described in a matter-of-fact way, but the poem's tone is one of sadness and loneliness.</p><p></p><p>The poem's title, "On the Threshing Floor, I Chase the Chickens Away," suggests that the speaker is alone on the threshing floor, and that chasing the chickens away is a task that they must perform alone. This sense of loneliness is further underscored by the speaker's description of the threshing floor as a "desolate place."</p><p></p><p>The speaker's solitude is further emphasized by the use of language in the poem. The speaker uses the pronoun "I" repeatedly, highlighting their isolation and lack of connection to others. The speaker's actions on the threshing floor are described using simple, straightforward language, suggesting a sense of detachment and distance from the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "On the Threshing Floor, I Chase the Chickens Away" is a poignant and evocative poem that explores the theme of loneliness and isolation through the metaphor of chasing away chickens on a threshing floor. It is a powerful reminder of the human desire for connection and the impact of loneliness on the human experience.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Battle" and "On the threatening floor, I chase Chicken Away" are two very different poems that share few common elements.</p><p></p><p>One element that they do share is the use of figurative language, such as metaphor and personification, to convey their messages. Both poems use figurative language to describe the actions and emotions of the speakers in the poems, adding depth and complexity to the writing.</p><p></p><p>However, the two poems differ in terms of their tone, subject matter, and style. "Battle" is a serious and somber poem that deals with the theme of war and the destructive nature of conflict. In contrast, "On the threatening floor, I chase Chicken Away" is a lighthearted and humorous poem that deals with the theme of domesticity and the mundane tasks of everyday life. The two poems also differ in terms of their style and structure, with "Battle" using a more traditional rhyme scheme and "On the threatening floor, I chase Chicken Away" using a more experimental and free-form structure.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while both poems use figurative language to convey their messages, they differ significantly in terms of tone, subject matter, and style.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>THE DIFFERENCE</strong> AND <strong>SIMILARITIES</strong> ASPECTS</p><p>The distinction between the two is that the <strong>Battle of Chu u yuan</strong> focuses on more than just grief and despair, whereas the threshing floor I chased away focuses more on an ordinary, realistic circumstance.</p><p>They both experience life with sorrow, anguish, pain, misery, and uncertainty.</p><p>Other details will be explained in the picture below.</p><p></p><p><strong>CHU U YUAN</strong></p><p>The poem <strong>Battle</strong> in Chinese literature was composed by<strong> Chu U Yuan</strong>, author of the classic poetry "Li Sao" or "Falling into Trouble" (332–295 B.C. ). Finding that he could not alter his prince's behavior, he committed suicide by drowning in the river Mi-lo. Supposedly, the present Dragon Boat Festival is held in his honor.</p><p>The subject of <strong>Chu U Yuan</strong>'s poem <strong>"Battle"</strong> is war. He emphasizes the two clans fighting for their beliefs with their lives on the line.</p><p></p><p><strong>YU XIUHUA</strong></p><p><strong>Yu Xiuhua</strong>'s poem "On the Rice Thresh1ng Ground, I Chase Chickens Away"</p><p>"On the Rice Thresh1ng Ground, I Chase Chickens Away" is a common title for her poems on her daily life. She lives her life with a poetic mind and a detached view of her immediate environment. She can only type with her left index finger, as suggested by the title of her novel, "Moon Falls on the Left Hand," therefore she may not write without the internet. But the poet, not the poet, is disabled. Or she may be physically but not mentally impaired. There are numerous contradictory opinions regarding her writing among <strong>Chinese poets</strong>. At the intersection of three thousand years of indigenous traditions and one hundred years of foreign influence, there is considerable uncertainty about what constitutes good poetry.</p><p>For decades, the ethnic minority has been one of the most contentious subjects in <strong>China</strong>'s political and cultural life. Numerous individuals have lost their native tongues but continue to write in <strong>Chinese</strong>. Whether chants, epics, or ballads, ethnic traditional poetry has different traditions. Most raw beauty is lost due to the "contamination" of secondhand modernism. However, many surprisingly excellent things can be discovered in the age of the internet.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about China Literature here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2926074</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><br />

                        The emotions that I feel after reading the poem<p>For the first poem, I found it sad that two different clans had to clash and appreciate each other's differences in terms of their values and ideals rather than fighting for their own perspective. They shouldn't have engaged in a brutal conflict, in my opinion, as it did them no favor and only resulted in the deaths of their own citizens. With regard to the second poem, I was pleased to learn that people had already recognized the value of their fields and were appreciative of the prosperity their land and other blessings—including crops like rice and wheat—had brought to their life. I had the impression that life before was superior to life now.</p><p></p>Comparison of the two poems<p>The similarities and differences between them will be compared. Because of the parallels, I think they both deal with <strong>nationalism </strong>because they displayed commitment and devotion. Additionally, I believe that both poems made use of sight or visual imagery. Finally, as they both tell a story, I think both can be categorized as narrative poetry. The difference is that the other poetry is about the basic existence that is oriented toward agriculture, however, in the battle, the main subject matter is patriotism because it is about a struggle between two clans where their loyalty to their homeland was evident. On the Threshing Floor, I Chase Chickens Away uses audio imagery in addition to visual imagery when creating its images. Last but not least, I think that based on their styles, the first poem can be classified as a ballad since it is an oral narrative song, and the second can be classified as a soliloquy because the character conveyed his thoughts and feelings.</p><p></p>The message each poem conveys<p>The first poem, Battle by Chu'ü Yüan, emphasizes <strong>peace </strong>more than battle, which wasn't represented in the poem because it was about a conflict between two clans. It sort of implies that we shouldn't make the same mistakes or follow the same pattern as they did, which led them to resort to war. The author seems to favor promoting togetherness despite the fact that different clans or groups may hold different philosophies. We should learn to value diversity in order to improve interactions between individuals, regardless of how dissimilar they may be.</p><p></p><p>The poem On the Threshing Floor, I Chase Chickens Away by Yu Xiuhua, on the other hand, conveys a message about the <strong>value of time</strong>. It was emphasized in the poem that time doesn't always remain the same and that is why we should pursue whatever we want to, as long as it is right.
