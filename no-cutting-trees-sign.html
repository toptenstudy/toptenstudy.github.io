                                            Activity 2. DIRECTIONS: Below are examples of explanation type of texts. Tell
what is being explained in each given text.
1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being
surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather
disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our
country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country.
The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather
disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the
air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-
pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As
the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds.
The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is
a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to
weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low
pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life
and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines.
Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding.
Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain
and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with
food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon.

4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population
increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts.
Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for
housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the
population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This
memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide
their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past.
They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play. (Source: Joy in Learning

There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains, strong winds are brought about by low pressure. 3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy our crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always a food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) 4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. 5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.

They have a lot of energy. You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</a>

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

Today they were going on a field trip to the zoo to see some of the animals they had learned about. Benjamin’s favorite was the sloth. He had never seen one, but he had learned a lot about them, and seen pictures of them. They were so cute. They had big round eyes, and looked like they were wearing a mask. The sloths in all of the pictures looked like they were smiling.Benjamin remembered a story he had read about sloths. The story said that many sloths live in the tropical forests in the South American country of Bolivia. Santa Cruz, a large city in Bolivia, has many large parks with old and beautiful trees. Years ago, many sloths lived in these trees. People liked to come to the parks and look for the sloths. Even though there were many sloths in the parks, they were hard to see. Their fur was as green as the leaves of the trees they lived in. Benjamin wished he could have visited one of those parks. He was sure he would have been able to spot the sloths, even if they were hard to see.The story went on to say that there was a problem with the sloths in the parks. Even though sloths don’t move very often, and are very, very slow when they do move, they do not like to be bothered. And if they are bothered, their long curved claws make very good weapons. Children in the parks, and even some adults, would poke at the sloths to try to get them to move. Some of these people got serious scratches and cuts from the sloths’ sharp claws. The city decided to move the sloths out of the parks and back to the forests that were their natural home. Benjamin decided that had been a good idea. The sloths would be safer, and so would the people.Benjamin class arrived at the zoo, and they finally came to the section where the sloths lived. The sign said there were two sloths. It was a large area, with many trees. Benjamin looked and looked, but he didn’t see the sloths. He was very disappointed. Then his teacher said, “Look there!” and pointed. And there was one of the sloths, just ten feet away from Benjamin, a little higher than his head. And it was even cuter in person than it was in the Pictures Do this:From the selection that you just read, write down 5 sentences that state facts and 5 sentences that express opinions.

                                            I. Directions: Read the following paragraphs then, identify their text type. Choose from DESCRIPTIVE, INFORMATIVE, NARRATIVE, PERSUASIVE, or PROCEDURAL.1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains, strong winds are brought about by low pressure. 3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy our crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always a food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) 4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. 5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.​</a>

                            4. Activity 2. DIRECTIONS: Below are examples of explanation type of texts. Tell
what is being explained in each given text.
1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being
surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather
disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our
country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country.
The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather
disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the
air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-
pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As
the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds.
The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is
a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to
weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low
pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life
and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines.
Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding.
Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain
and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with
food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon.

4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population
increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts.
Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for
housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the
population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This
memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide
their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past.
They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play. (Source: Joy in Learning

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, the Philippines is visited by an average of 20 typhoons every year, five of which are destructive. Being situated in the “Pacific Ring of Fire” makes it vulnerable to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Its geographical location and physical environment also contributes to its high-susceptibility to tsunami, sea level rise, storm surges, landslides, flood/flashflood/flooding, and drought.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

                            19. Activity 4:Remember:➢ If something is true, or it really happened, it is a fact.➢ If something is what someone thinks or believes, it is an opinionAs you read, think about what parts are fact and what parts are opinionBenjamin’s class was learning about unusual animals. Today they were going on a field trip to the zoo to see some of the animals they had learned about. Benjamin’s favorite was the sloth. He had never seen one, but he had learned a lot about them, and seen pictures of them. They were so cute. They had big round eyes, and looked like they were wearing a mask. The sloths in all of the pictures looked like they were smiling.Benjamin remembered a story he had read about sloths. The story said that many sloths live in the tropical forests in the South American country of Bolivia. Santa Cruz, a large city in Bolivia, has many large parks with old and beautiful trees. Years ago, many sloths lived in these trees. People liked to come to the parks and look for the sloths. Even though there were many sloths in the parks, they were hard to see. Their fur was as green as the leaves of the trees they lived in. Benjamin wished he could have visited one of those parks. He was sure he would have been able to spot the sloths, even if they were hard to see.The story went on to say that there was a problem with the sloths in the parks. Even though sloths don’t move very often, and are very, very slow when they do move, they do not like to be bothered. And if they are bothered, their long curved claws make very good weapons. Children in the parks, and even some adults, would poke at the sloths to try to get them to move. Some of these people got serious scratches and cuts from the sloths’ sharp claws. The city decided to move the sloths out of the parks and back to the forests that were their natural home. Benjamin decided that had been a good idea. The sloths would be safer, and so would the people.Benjamin class arrived at the zoo, and they finally came to the section where the sloths lived. The sign said there were two sloths. It was a large area, with many trees. Benjamin looked and looked, but he didn’t see the sloths. He was very disappointed. Then his teacher said, “Look there!” and pointed. And there was one of the sloths, just ten feet away from Benjamin, a little higher than his head. And it was even cuter in person than it was in the Pictures Do this:From the selection that you just read, write down 5 sentences that state facts and 5 sentences that express opinions.

The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains, strong winds are brought about by low pressure. 3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy our crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always a food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) 4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. 5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.​</h2><br />
