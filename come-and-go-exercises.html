                            19. If you're feeling frightened about what comes next, don't be. Embrace the uncertainty. Allow it to lead you places. Be brave as it challenges you to exercise both your heart and your mind as you create your own path toward happiness; don't waste time with regret. Spin wildly into your next action. Enjoy the present, each moment, as it comes, because you'll never get another one quite like it. And if you should ever look up and find yourself lost, simply take a breath and start over. Retrace your steps and go back to the purest place in your heart...where your hope lives. You'll find your way again.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I understand that uncertainty can be challenging for individuals. It's essential to remind yourself that change is inevitable and that it's okay to feel uncomfortable with it. Embracing ambiguity can lead to new opportunities, growth, and learning experiences. Don't allow regret to hold you back from taking action towards your happiness.</p><p></p><p>It's crucial to focus on the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future. Each moment presents us with an opportunity to learn, grow, and enjoy life. If you find yourself feeling lost, take a step back, breathe, and reflect. Remember the values and principles that guide you toward your aspirations. You will find your way again. Trust in yourself, and keep moving forward.</p><p></p><br />

1. In this Footwork, you cross your legs to each other for you to reach and hit the on coming ball.
2. In this Footwork, you need to move forward to do yiur stroke and then return to ready position. If you want to move closer to the ball, position your right leg under the table. And the play your shot and go back in ready position.
3. In this Footwork, always move your out-side foot whether you are moving to the left or right.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Crossover Footwork </p><p>2.In and Out Footwork</p><p>3.Side to side Footwork</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Side to side Footwork  </p><p>
</p><p>When to use this? This is the main footwork pattern used in table tennis.  </p><p>
</p><p>This is done swiftly when you are close to the table. Always move your outside foot whether you are moving to the left or right.
</p><p>
</p><p>Starting from your base position, to move from a backhand to a forehand, you move from your left foot to the right foot followed by your left then back to the right foot, creating short quick steps in a shuffling pattern from side to side.  </p><p>
</p><p>As for moving from a forehand to a backhand, you start moving your right foot first before your left and then right and lastly left.  </p><p>
</p><p>2. In and Out Footwork
</p><p>
</p><p>When to use this? This is employed to return a short service.  </p><p>
</p><p>To make this return, move your body forwards (IN) to reach the ball to play your stroke and afterwards return back (OUT) to the ready position.  </p><p>
</p><p>When moving inwards towards the ball, step your right foot forward positioning your right leg under the table. After playing your shot, return back to the base position.  </p><p>
</p><p>Your left foot moves followed by the movement of your right foot under the table. After playing your stroke, your right foot then moves back outwards and your left foot returns back to base position.  </p><p>
</p><p>Simply put, the footwork is: left, right, right and finally left.  </p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>3. Crossover Footwork  </p><p>
</p><p>When to use this? When you need to return at a faster pace.
</p><p>
</p><p>If the ball advances wide to your forehand side, you can use this crossover footwork pattern as it is faster than using the side to side footwork. As the name suggests, your legs cross over each other for you to reach and catch the oncoming ball at a faster pace.  </p><p>
</p><p>To move from the backhand side to the wide forehand side, you cross your leg foot wide to the right side. Then using the left foot as a pivot, shift your weight to your left foot. You should transfer your body rightwards and move your right foot across as you play your shot.  </p><p></p><br />

                            30. SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS: A diet that promise quick results with little effort easily earns and loses popularity shortly after consumers realize it as just a false advertisement. These kinds of diet are "fad" as they come and go. Any diet claiming instant results without exercise or reduction of calorie intake will not reduce body fat. We all know that diet is not as easy as we think it is. Now, I want you to write an essay regarding Fad Diets for Weight Control.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Fad diets are dietary habits that are practiced with the exaggerated purpose of curing a specific disease, and expressing a specific life style such as weight loss. Losing weight is effortless as gaining it. Currently, a lot of weight loss products are available including the most common way that involves using the pill. It is well recognized that fad is not the suitable way of losing weight and better methods exist. Instead of demonizing it, it is essential to learn how deal with it. One just needs to eat fewer calories than the body can synthesis, raise the activity level and decrease the calories consumed to lose weight safely, but this seems to be procedural without promising result forcing many to opt for fad diets.</p><br />
