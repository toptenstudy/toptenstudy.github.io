                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973 (MacKinnon,2018). Despite the legality, both pro-lifers and pro-choice advocates have stood on opposite ends of the issue. Those who are passionate about either side have valid points to the moral issue at hand. What this really boils down to is who has more rights-the women who wants to decide for herself when she wants to reproduce or the unborn fetus? The fetus does not have a voice; therefore, pro-lifers speak for them. Pro-life advocates stress that termination should never be an option. </p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps pa brainly po</p><p>#CARRY_ON_LEARNING</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Abortion is considered as one of the most controversial issues. It is an argument between life and death. The uncertainty of its complications makes the issue more challenging to deal with. Abortion refers to the termination of pregnancy by removing the fetus or the embryo from the uterus before it is ready to take birth.</p><p></p><p>Abortions are one of the most common methods to end a pregnancy. It is one of the safest procedures to terminate a pregnancy through medicine. An abortion that occurs without clinical intervention is known as miscarriage and occurs in almost 30% to 50% of pregnancies. Unsafe abortion can lead to maternal death; hence it is always safe to go for clinical procedures.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>NO, Because Divorce has been seen to have a negative effect on the children involved, especially during the transition period as they deal with the separation of their parents. This may manifest in various ways such as diminished social skills, proneness to anger and increased irritability.Divorce also does not safeguard or promote the mental and physical health of children as it is difficult to cope with one’s problems when one’s family, their main support system, is broken apart.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the divorce may influence the child into losing faith in the concept of a family entirely, which leads to another negative effect of this process. If divorce were to be legalized, it would amplify the mentality that marriage can be easily broken, which may result in people putting less effort into making it last and ensuring that they will pick the right partner. The family is thus put into danger and further exposed to the risk of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Abortion should not be legalized in the Philippines for it is a painful surgery. Despite the use of such anesthetics, Almost 97% of women that committed abortions have been reported experiencing extreme pain during the procedure. Compared to other pains, researchers have rated the pain from abortion as more afflictive than a bone fracture, about the same as cancer pain. The use of more powerful general anesthetics can reduce the pain, but it increases the risk of cervical injury. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraph 1: Abortion is a controversial issue in the Philippines, as it is in many countries. The government has long held a stance against granting women the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, and the church has been vocal in its opposition to allowing women the choice to have an abortion. Despite this opposition, there are many arguments in favor of legalizing abortion in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 2: One of the main arguments in support of legalizing abortion is the protection of women's health. Terminating a pregnancy can be safer for the mother than carrying a child to term. In some cases, the physical and mental health of the mother is at risk if she is forced to give birth. Legalizing abortion will allow women to make informed decisions about their own health and safety. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 3: Another argument in favor of legalizing abortion is that it will help reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. Unplanned pregnancies can lead to poverty and other negative outcomes, so giving women access to safe and legal abortions can help them avoid these situations. Allowing women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health is a major step towards gender equality.

                        Abortion, as we all know, has been used many times on innocent undevelop babies. One main reason why women would do such is first, because they aren't prepared to be a mother, second, because their partner left them and they got nothing else to supply the baby's basic needs and last one, is because they assume that the baby is a "mistake". But what they are missing is that even how many problems, trials and even "mistakes" they would make, that baby, even if you turn the world upside down, is life. It is another life. A blessing, and the joy to which you would experience upon seeing it.<br /><br />Yet why do some women or even young ladies abort such a beautiful thing? Lust is a word that can be interconnected with this matter. Some say the baby is "just a mistake" but actually the baby is not the mistake, rather, they are the ones. If they hadnt gone overboard and do things that they are still not ready yet, then why go with the flow with it? <br /><br />Carrying and delivering a baby is hard. All women know that. Experiencing pain, sorrows and everything. But after you have a life within you, why not keep it? Even if it's hard at first, at the end, all those pain and all those sufferings are worth it. Joy and laughter would definitely replaced those negative and bad emotions. You just need to endure it, ask advices too and most especially, when carrying it, fill that baby all the love you could give it. Don't just deliver and carry it for the sake of getting rid of the burden, cherish it because sooner or later, you will really regret.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>PIP: Recent epidemiologic studies have found that spontaneous abortion has no association with breast cancer, while induced abortion is associated with a moderately increased risk. Although this finding may, in part, reflect confounding and ascertainment bias, there are credible biologic reasons for a difference in risk between these two events. Experiments with rats have indicated that proliferated but not differentiated terminal duct and lobular cells increase the susceptibility of breast tissue to carcinogens. Since ductal and lobuloalveolar breast cells proliferate in the first two trimesters of pregnancy and differentiate in the third, it would follow that the later (up through the late second trimester) the pregnancy is terminated, the greater the risk. Although there is a trend toward induced abortion at earlier gestational ages, spontaneous abortion tends to be the earlier event. Even when induced and spontaneous abortions occur at the same gestational age, dead embryos or fetuses are probably retained in utero for several weeks before expulsion, meaning hormone levels drop appreciably earlier than is the case with induced abortion, where the hormone profile drops only after termination. Moreover, since the average time to another pregnancy is significantly shorter after spontaneous abortion (12 months), the protective effect of subsequent full-term pregnancies may dilute the risk effect of spontaneous abortion to a greater extent than is the case with induced abortion. Now that most induced abortions occur in the first trimester, the implications for breast cancer risk should become minimal for both types of interrupted pregnancies.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Abortion is a topic that has incites many people from all around the world. While most believe it is wrong to have abortion, some think that it is a need and an essential right to women and they should have access to it. For me, I completely agree with the people who think we should have abortion even though I believe that every woman should have the right to choose what happens to her body, including whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Denying women the right to abortion violates their basic human rights. Women should have the right to choose what they do with their bodies and should not be forced to carry a baby if they don't want to. There are numerous reasons why women needs to terminate a baby, including financial problems, health concerns, or simply being unfit to raise a child. It isn't right to force them to carry a baby from their condition, especially because it could harm their mental or physical health or even their ability to take care of themselves and their childrens.So i say that we keep abortion clinics open as if we don't it may violate their freedom and reproductive rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

You need to take responsibility for what you did and have the baby. It didn't ask to be conceived. But you conceived it. You’re now responsible for it. You can give it up for adoption after it's born (I don't approve of this either, because it's also a cop-out, but at least you're giving the child you so irresponsibly created a shot at life). But killing it is not the answer.</p>A<strong>nswer:</strong>  <strong>not abortion</strong>Explanation:<strong>We disagree in abortion is it because it stated in the Bible that we should never kill.

                        ABORTION<p></p>Are you in favor of using contraceptives and abortion as means of family planning?<p></p>ANSWER<p></p>For me, it's a <strong>yes</strong>. Thinking about the situation of our country right now, it is indeed hard to get a job for your family to survive in. Having intercourse with our partners in times of pandemic especially when the majority are ordered to stay home, is normal and can't be prevented. The result of this intercourse causes another charge in money for anyone. So yes, I'm in favor, this is to reduce the population in our country who's living in an impoverished family. They usually get sick and can't be guided by their parents because of a lack of money. This is <strong>for the sake of those people who are not ready for the responsibility of gaining another baby.</strong> But, take note that I'm not enticing everyone to do this. Before doing this "thing", it's better to be married first and get a suitable job. It's still a life of a baby that is at risk, it's only for those who are not yet ready to raise a baby.<p></p><p>#BrainliestChallenge2021</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Tips are provided on how to write an argumentative essay on abortion
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you are going to write an argumentative essay on abortion, you need to be able to present compelling arguments and data to support them.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>An argumentative essay is where a student presents both side of a given situation. You will need to investigate, collect data, present them and establish your own position on the matter.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So on the matter of abortion there will be two sides:  pro and against. But first define what abortion is and research on Philippine laws covering abortion.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Are we allowed to have it?
</strong></p><p><strong>Are there abortion clinics here like they have in the USA? What happens to woman if they have an abortion?
</strong></p><p><strong>How many babies are aborted every day?
</strong></p><p><strong>These are some of the preliminary questions you need to know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Now, after establishing the scenario, you need to take a stand, whether you are for it or against it. If for it, what arguments will you use? You could probably cite that a woman's body belong to her so it is her right. If you are against, you can probably argue that abortion is the same as killing a child, hence immoral and illegal.

Whether the comments are in favor of or opposed to the procedure, they should come from a well-informed, respectful, and non-judgmental perspective.</p><p></p><p>Explanation in abortion moral typically involves exploring the moral implications of abortion by looking at the various ethical theories and beliefs that are relevant to the subject. This involves looking at effects on the fetus, the circumstances of the pregnancy, the role of autonomy and personal agency, the impact on society, and the consequences for both the mother and the wider community.</p><p></p><p>Reaction in abortion moral can vary widely depending on the individual's perspective and the dynamics of the discussion. Many reactions can be emotional or intellectual, but either way, it is important to remain respectful of different beliefs and opinions.</p><p></p><p>What can you say in abortion moral depends on the context and one's personal beliefs. Depending on the particulars of the situation, one might speak about the importance of providing a safe and supportive environment for women to make decisions about their reproductive lives, the need for access to safe and legal abortion services, or the importance of respecting the privacy and autonomy of people in making decisions about their own bodies.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial topic that has been the subject of much debate and discussion over the years. It is the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable outside the womb, either through medical procedures or natural means. While some people believe that abortion should be legal and easily accessible, others believe that it is morally wrong and should be illegal. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate and discuss the ethical and moral implications of abortion.</p><p></p><p>Those who support legalizing abortion argue that it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. They argue that a woman should have the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, especially in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's health is in danger. Additionally, they point out that outlawing abortion does not prevent it from happening, but rather drives it underground, putting women's health and safety at risk.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, opponents of abortion argue that it is morally wrong to end a human life, and that the fetus has the same rights as any other human being. They argue that abortion is a form of murder and should be illegal in all cases. Some also argue that there are alternative options, such as adoption, for women who do not want to raise a child.</p><p></p><p>The debate over abortion often centers around the question of when life begins. Some argue that life begins at conception, while others believe that it begins at birth or at some point in between. This is a difficult question to answer, as it is subjective and depends on one's personal beliefs and values.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the legal and political implications of abortion, there are different approaches taken by different countries. Some countries, such as the United States, have legalized abortion but have placed restrictions on it, such as requiring parental consent for minors or prohibiting late-term abortions. Other countries, such as Ireland, have only recently legalized abortion after years of strict bans.</p><p></p><p>From an ethical perspective, the debate over abortion raises important questions about the value of life, the rights of women, and the role of government in regulating personal choices. It is important to consider the various perspectives on this issue and to engage in constructive dialogue that seeks to find common ground and respect for different viewpoints.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the topic of abortion is complex and controversial, with strong arguments on both sides. While it is important to respect differing opinions, it is also important to consider the ethical and moral implications of this issue. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to legalize abortion is one that must be made by society as a whole, taking into account the values, beliefs, and needs of all individuals involved.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>paki-brainliest po, atsaka i summarize mo na din.</p><p></p><br />

                            27. Write an argumentative essay of controversial topics related to Christianity about Abortion with Introduction, Body, Conclusion, Overall​</h2><br />
                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial topic in Christianity, with divergent opinions and beliefs. Some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to murder, while others argue that it is a personal choice and that women should have the right to decide what happens to their bodies. This essay explores the argumentative issues surrounding abortion in Christianity, highlighting both sides of the debate.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>On one hand, those who oppose abortion believe that it is morally wrong to take the life of an unborn child. For Christians, life is sacred and should be protected at all costs. Many Christians argue that since life begins at conception, any deliberate termination of pregnancy is a violation of God's commandment not to kill. They believe that life is a gift from God, and no one has the right to take it away. Such people may also argue that every child has a purpose in life, and that aborting a pregnancy deprives the child of their destiny.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, supporters of abortion in Christianity argue that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the woman carrying the fetus. They believe that women have the right to make choices about their bodies, including whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. They argue that forcing women to continue unwanted pregnancies is cruel and unjust, and that it can lead to emotional and psychological distress for both the mother and the child.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, some Christians believe that there are circumstances where abortion may be necessary, such as when the mother's life is at risk, or when the fetus has severe abnormalities that would make survival after birth unlikely. In such cases, they argue that it is better to terminate the pregnancy than to allow the mother or the child to suffer.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the issue of abortion in Christianity is a highly contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. While some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is equivalent to murder, others argue that women should have the right to make choices about their bodies. It is important to respect each other's views and opinions on this matter, and to recognize that it is often a deeply personal and emotional issue. Ultimately, Christians should strive to find common ground and work towards solutions that protect both the sanctity of life and the rights of women.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recently, there are many controversial topics in this world, and abortion is one of them. It was not a big problem before; however, recently the number of abortions increases rapidly. In some countries abortion is legalized; nevertheless, I strongly disagree with this idea. I believe that abortion should be illegal. In this essay, I'll show my opinions why I don't agree with abortion.</p><p></p><p>First, everyone should have responsibility for their behavior. Some people think that abortion is an easy way to avoid having a baby. Therefore, they mate whenever they want. And after that, if they notice a pregnancy, they'll go to the hospital. It sounds very easy; however, it sounds that they lack responsibility for their behavior to me. Abortion means to kill a new life and to endanger a woman's body. It seems that people who have an abortion easily think the fetus is just a "thing." If they don't want to have a baby, there are ways to avoid having a baby before pregnancy. Therefore, to rely on just abortion means they don't have any responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Second, as I mentioned before, abortion is dangerous for a woman's body. Recently, many people try to have an abortion; thus, it causes misunderstanding. Abortion is not the easy way that people think. It's possible that a woman can't have a baby anymore because it hurts the woman's body. Besides, it's possible that women die because of it. Unfortunately, many people don't know the reality. From my point of view, it's because of the lack of education about abortion. The women who are pregnant don't know what abortion does to their body.</p><p></p><p>Third, the baby, whether he/she is born or not, has the right to live. Who can say that the baby has no hope? It's possible that the baby can have a better life than ours. We don't have any right to kill a newborn baby. Moreover, I think only human beings do abortion. Humans are the only animals that kill their babies intentionally.</p><br />

                            30. write an essay about your thoughts of contraception and abortion?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The misunderstanding arises from the fact that, contrary to popular belief, the prevalence of contraception and the incidence of induced abortion can and often do increase in lockstep within specific populations. These counterintuitive trends have a simple explanation. 2 In cultures where the fertility process has not yet occurred, real fertility as well as ideal family sizes are also high (or, to put it another way, childbearing is not yet considered to be "within the calculus of conscious choice"3). Couples in such communities have a low (or no) chance of unintended pregnancies. High (or "fatalistic") reproductive desires have been destabilized since the introduction of modern contraceptives. As contraception use becomes more widespread and fertility continues to decrease, a rising number of couples want no more children (or want to wait a long time before having another), raising the risk of unintended pregnancy. When it comes to fertility change, the early and middle stages are crucial. couples who want to delay or restrict childbearing still have a long way to go in terms of adopting and maintaining successful contraceptive methods. As a result, the increasing demand for contraception may outstrip availability;4 as a result, the number of unintended and unwanted pregnancies increases, fueling an increase in unwanted live births and induced abortions. Contraceptive use and induced abortion can increase at the same time in this scenario.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Make your own essay next time.</p><br />
