                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Senior High School Strand</p><p></p><p>Senior High School is a two-year specialized upper secondary education program in which students can specialize based on their aptitude, hobbies, and school competence. The substance of a student's subjects in Grades 11 and 12 will be determined by his or her professional path. Subjects in SHS are divided into two categories: Core Curriculum and Tracks.</p><p></p><p>THE ESSENTIAL CURRICULUM</p><p></p><p>The Core Curriculum is divided into seven learning areas. Languages, Literature, Communication, Mathematics, Philosophy, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences are the disciplines in question. The SHS curriculum includes current topics from various General Education subjects.</p><p></p><p>TRACKS</p><p></p><p>Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and Sports and Arts are the three tracks available to Senior High School students. Business, Accountancy, and Management (BAM); Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences (HESS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) .</p><p></p><p>STEM STRAND</p><p></p><p>When implemented in the actual world, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are intertwined disciplines. The focus on advanced concepts and themes distinguishes the STEM curriculum from the other strands and tracks.</p><p></p><p>You can train to be a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, a biologist, a chemist, an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, and many more professions by following the track. This track is recommended for those who are also interested in Marine Engineering.</p><p></p><p>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teaches critical thinking and innovation. Students can establish mental habits that will help them succeed in any subject by focusing on logical thought processes and problem-solving. Students are challenged to think critically and come up with their own ideas as part of their STEM training.</p><p></p><p>A great STEM class promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance, teamwork, and communication. Good STEM education enables students to see the connections between these courses and to acquire soft skills for the world in which we all live and work.</p><p></p><p>I like the critical thinking to be enhanced and in STEM strand, it will be well practiced with the help of the assessment given all throughout the curriculum.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

In addition to participating more often in class, you will be exposed to a greater variety of subjects and will need to manage a more challenging workload.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant differences between junior high school and elementary school is the increased academic and social challenges. It is a time when you will begin to develop more independent thinking and explore your own interests. You will need to refine your study skills and take on more difficult work. Therefore, my advice to someone starting high school would be to get involved in extracurricular activities, make friends with people who share similar interests, focus on your academics, develop good study habits, and don't be afraid to ask for help when needed.</p><p></p><p>To manage the workload efficiently, creating a study schedule and sticking to it is crucial. It is essential to prioritize and allocate time for each subject and assignment, and avoid procrastination. In addition to focusing on academics, getting involved in extracurricular activities and building relationships with classmates and teachers can enhance the junior high school experience.</p><p></p><p>The most challenging aspect of junior high school is making the transition from the carefree days of elementary school to the more competitive and demanding environment of high school. You will face the challenge of expanding your knowledge and mastering new skills in all core academic areas. However, staying focused, organized, and seeking help from your teachers can help you overcome these challenges.</p><p></p><p>It is normal to feel homesick or overwhelmed during this time of transition. In such situations, it is important to socialize, keep in touch with old friends and family as much as possible, and seek assistance if necessary.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, if I could go back, I would have worked harder in school and avoided procrastination. I would have also been more proactive in seeking help when needed and participated more in extracurricular activities. It is important to take advantage of all the opportunities available in junior high school to learn and grow as a person</p><br />

                            12. Essay: Reflection on Your Study of Contemporary Philippine Art from the RegionsReflect on your study of Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions in Senior High School. What was your experience in studying it? How effective was your study of the said subject?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>here hehe I hope my answer is worth it and helpful to you :)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions in Senior High School has been an enriching experience for me. Before taking the subject, I only had a superficial understanding of Philippine art, particularly on its historical and cultural significance. However, the subject has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation of the richness and diversity of Philippine art, particularly its contemporary expressions.</p><p></p><p>My experience in studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions has been positive overall. I was able to explore and discover various art forms and practices across different regions in the Philippines, and I learned about the different issues and concerns that artists in these regions tackle in their works. Moreover, the subject allowed me to appreciate the different contexts and experiences that shape the creation of art, and how art can reflect and respond to social, political, and cultural realities.</p><p></p><p>The subject was effective in teaching me about different art forms and techniques, and the different ways in which artists use them to convey meaning and evoke emotions. The lectures, discussions, and activities helped me understand the underlying concepts and theories that inform contemporary Philippine art, and how these concepts and theories are translated into actual artworks. Moreover, the subject provided me with opportunities to engage with artworks and to critically analyze them, which further deepened my understanding and appreciation of art.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also challenges in studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions. One of the challenges was the limited exposure to actual artworks, as most of the lectures and discussions were conducted online due to the pandemic. This made it difficult to fully appreciate and understand the artworks, as the online platform does not provide the same experience as viewing the artworks in person. Another challenge was the limited time to explore and discuss all the different art forms and practices across the different regions in the Philippines, which left me wanting to learn more.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions has been an enriching experience for me, and it has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation of the richness and diversity of Philippine art. The subject was effective in teaching me about different art forms and techniques, and how these are used to convey meaning and evoke emotions. Despite the challenges, I am grateful for the opportunity to study this subject, and I look forward to continuing to explore and learn about Philippine art.</p><br />

                            14. LEARNING ACTIVITY 4: IT'S TIME TO WRITE (Reflective Essay)Write an essay by answering the following question: How do socialstratification differences affect your life as a Senior High Schoolstudent?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A person’s social class has a significant impact on their physical health, their ability to receive adequate medical care and nutrition, and their life expectancy. While gender and race play significant roles in explaining healthcare inequality in the United States, socioeconomic status (SES) is the greatest social determinant of an individual’s health outcome. Social determinants of health are the economic and social conditions that influence individual and group differences in health status. Social determinants are environmental, meaning that they are risk factors found in one’s living and working conditions (including the distribution of income, wealth, influence, and power), rather than individual factors (such as behavioral risk factors or genetics). Social determinants can be used to predict one’s risk of contracting a disease or sustaining an injury, and can also indicate how vulnerable one is to the consequences of a disease or injury. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status have lower levels of overall health, less insurance coverage, and less access to adequate healthcare than those of higher SES.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Senior High School Strand</strong></p><p>Senior High School is a two-year specialized upper secondary education program in which students can specialize based on their aptitude, hobbies, and school competence. The substance of a student's subjects in Grades 11 and 12 will be determined by his or her professional path. Subjects in SHS are divided into two categories: Core Curriculum and Tracks.</p><p></p><p><strong>THE ESSENTIAL CURRICULUM</strong></p><p>The Core Curriculum is divided into seven learning areas. Languages, Literature, Communication, Mathematics, Philosophy, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences are the disciplines in question. The SHS curriculum includes current topics from various General Education subjects.</p><p></p><p><strong>TRACKS</strong></p><p>Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and Sports and Arts are the three tracks available to Senior High School students. Business, Accountancy, and Management (BAM); Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences (HESS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) .</p><p></p><p><strong>STEM STRAND</strong></p><p>When implemented in the actual world, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are intertwined disciplines. The focus on advanced concepts and themes distinguishes the STEM curriculum from the other strands and tracks.</p><p></p><p>You can train to be a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, a biologist, a chemist, an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, and many more professions by following the track. This track is recommended for those who are also interested in Marine Engineering.</p><p></p><p>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teaches critical thinking and innovation. Students can establish mental habits that will help them succeed in any subject by focusing on logical thought processes and problem-solving. Students are challenged to think critically and come up with their own ideas as part of their STEM training.</p><p></p><p>A great STEM class promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance, teamwork, and communication. Good STEM education enables students to see the connections between these courses and to acquire soft skills for the world in which we all live and work.</p><p></p><p>I like the critical thinking to be enhanced and in STEM strand, it will be well practiced with the help of the assessment given all throughout the curriculum.</p><p></p><p><strong>Other Senior High School Strands</strong></p><p><strong>1.
