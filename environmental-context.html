                        <p><strong>Answer:<br /><br />In the Philippines, there are many social issues that need to be addressed. One of the most pressing issues is the use of technology. While technology can bring about many benefits, it can also lead to negative consequences such as cyberbullying, addiction, and the spread of fake news.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As the President of the Philippines, I would prioritize addressing the negative impacts of technology. This would involve promoting responsible use of technology and increasing education on how to avoid cyberbullying and how to identify fake news. I would also work to create stricter regulations on the use of social media platforms to ensure that they are not being used to spread hate speech or propaganda.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To resolve this issue, I would collaborate with educators, parents, and technology companies to develop programs that promote responsible use of technology, provide counseling services for those affected by cyberbullying, and implement measures to prevent the spread of fake news. It is important that we work together as a society to address the negative impacts of technology while still enjoying its benefits.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: I Choose "Technology" on this one. Why Technology?<br /><br />Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives and has brought significant changes in the way we communicate, learn, work, and interact with others. While it has many benefits, it also poses various challenges and issues that need to be addressed. These issues range from the digital divide, cyberbullying, privacy concerns, addiction, and the impact of technology on mental health, among others. These issues affect different segments of society, and it is important to prioritize them and find solutions that will ensure that technology is used responsibly and for the greater good. As such, it is essential to consider technology as a social issue that requires our attention and action.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Environmental scanning is the process of gathering and analyzing information about the external factors that could potentially affect an organization. It is a crucial step in the strategic management process, as it allows organizations to identify opportunities and threats in the external environment and make informed decisions about how to respond to them. Some of the factors that organizations typically scan for include economic conditions, political and legal developments, technological advances, and changes in consumer behavior.</p><p></p><p>Environmental scanning is considered relevant and important in strategic management for several reasons. Firstly, it allows organizations to anticipate and respond to changes in the external environment, rather than being caught off guard by unexpected developments. This can help organizations to maintain a competitive advantage and avoid potential risks. Secondly, environmental scanning can help organizations identify new opportunities for growth and expansion, such as untapped markets or emerging technologies. Finally, environmental scanning can also inform organizations about potential changes in regulations or policies that could impact their operations and help them to prepare for compliance.</p><br />

                            22. Is a compromise between environmental protection and economic development possible in the context of our country?​</h2><br />
                        <p>It is possible to achieve a balance between environmental protection and economic development, although it can be challenging. Some strategies that can help to achieve this balance include:</p><p></p><p>Implementing policies that incentivize sustainable practices and technologies: Governments can use a variety of tools, such as tax credits, subsidies, and regulations, to encourage businesses and individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices.</p><p></p><p>Encouraging the development of green technologies: Governments can invest in research and development of green technologies to help reduce the environmental impact of economic development.</p><p></p><p>Promoting the use of natural resources in a sustainable way: Governments can implement policies that encourage the sustainable use of natural resources, such as forests, water, and land, to help ensure that they are available for future generations.</p><p></p><p>Encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources: Governments can promote the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>Overall, it is important for governments, businesses, and individuals to work together to find solutions that protect the environment while also supporting economic growth.</p><p></p><p>It is possible to find a balance between environmental protection and economic development, and many countries have implemented policies and practices that aim to do so. It can involve finding ways to minimize the negative impacts of economic activities on the environment while allowing economic growth and prosperity. For example, this might include adopting more sustainable and efficient production methods, investing in clean energy sources, and creating regulations and incentives to encourage environmentally responsible behavior. It can also involve finding ways to use natural resources sustainably over the long term rather than exploiting them until they are depleted.</p><p></p><p>Finding this balance is not always easy, and it may involve making trade-offs and difficult decisions. It is essential to consider the long-term impacts of economic and environmental policies carefully and to involve all stakeholders in the decision-making process. Ultimately, a successful approach to balancing environmental protection and economic development will depend on the specific circumstances and resources of each country.</p><br />

                        ARGUMENTS USING F.E.L.T FRAMEWORK<p>In the context of the political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental situations in the Philippines. Below are answers using FELT as in Awareness, Professionalism, Values, Care and Community.</p><p></p><strong>Argument #1 </strong><p><strong>Using FELT Framework</strong></p><p><strong>Awareness:</strong><strong> </strong>demonstrate the capability of a<strong> very basic asset pricing</strong> model if one permits even tiny departures from reasonable expectations, it is possible to reproduce a wide range of stylized facts.</p><p><strong>Professionalism:</strong><strong> </strong>Stock <strong>price fluctuations</strong> are very difficult to replicate within the context of rational expectations.</p><p><strong>Values:</strong> Through surveys, studies, and <strong>micro-evidence, the behavioral </strong>finance literature explored the nexus between economics and psychology in an effort to understand how individual investors make decisions.</p><p><strong>Care and Community: </strong>Because agents only learn about an exogenous dividend process, even though their <strong>views affect market outcomes</strong>, their beliefs are unaffected by those outcomes. In these models do not speak in the language of stochastic control.</p><p></p>Argument #2<p><strong>Using FELT Framework</strong></p><p><strong>Awareness: </strong> In the literature on the early researchers who devoted their lives to X-rays and ultimately perished doing so. Since then, radiology has matured. <strong>Large exposure periods</strong> have been shortened to milliseconds, and analog cameras have been replaced by digital ones.</p><p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Clinical forensic medicine is the use of medical expertise to evaluate injuries in living people in order to administer justice. Unfortunately, in several nations, the <strong>forensic examination</strong> of living people is a rather undeveloped area of forensic practice.</p><p><strong>Values:</strong> Internationally, torture is acknowledged, and a number of medical organizations have been <strong>established to protect victims</strong>. The Medical Foundation for the Treatment of Torture Victims, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), and numerous other nongovernmental organizations seek to uphold victims' rights.</p><p><strong>Care and Community: </strong> According to Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The medical community, especially the <strong>forensic community</strong>, has a responsibility and right to investigate and report any type of human rights violation.</p><p></p>Argument #3<p><strong>Using FELT Framework</strong></p><p><strong>Awareness:</strong> The month of February is dedicated to celebrating African Americans' efforts and achievements to the development of the United States. <strong>Black History Month </strong>honors the vibrant cultural legacy, victories, and adversities that have left a lasting imprint on the history of our nation.</p><p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> White supremacist culture—or the systemic, institutionalized centering of whiteness—heavily defines the criteria of professionalism, according to American grassroots organizer-scholars. White supremacist <strong>culture emphasizes whiteness in the workplace</strong>, discriminating against non-Western and non-white professionals, and favoring whiteness in terms of dress code, speech, work style, and timeliness.</p><p><strong>Values: </strong>The ideals of honesty, integrity, and treating one's fellow human beings with compassion were instilled in their children despite the ignorance and insensitivity of their oppressors; this <strong>mentality still permeates many contemporary</strong> African American families.</p><p><strong>Care and Community: </strong>A vital component of the Success Sequence, a procedure that aids people in <strong>avoiding poverty and results</strong> in fulfilling employment, <strong>prosperous financial situations, and relational lives</strong>, are healthy relationships and strong family ties. In other words, it results in a full and prosperous life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about political issues: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6976205?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>Learn more about economic impact: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4527071?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>Learn more about socio-cultural situation:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5912367?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>Learn more about environmental action:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12749102?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
