Write a 200-word essay to answer the question.Answer. The advantages of mountaineering include the fact that it has a beneficial effect on one's mental health. It will help you focus and be more creative. Additionally, it enhances agility and self-awareness. Mountaineering has a plethora of advantages. The most obvious benefits are increased physical and cardiovascular fitness, as well as body fat reduction through aerobic exercise. Several other less obvious or tangible benefits include a significant increase in personal confidence and collaborative skills, which may be applied in either the workplace or personal life. The disadvantages of mountaineering include the fact that climbers encounter a multitude of risks. Hazards are classified into two types: objective and subjective. An objective hazard is one that is related to the environment and may include adverse weather, hazardous terrain, or inadequate equipment. Subjective hazard, on the other hand, refers to a mountaineer's poor judgment, poor planning, lack of skill, or insufficient conditioning. Another threat is falling rocks, the mountaineer's falling, and altitude and weather-related problems.​</a>

Question: How can we prevent malnutrition and eating disorder? How can wellness help you be physically fit and a better person? 
Salamat sa sasagot ☺☺☺☺</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Are you worried that someone you know has malnutrition, anorexia, bulimia, or another eating disorder? </p><p></p><p>Eating disorders involve extreme disturbances in eating behaviors—following rigid diets, bingeing on food in secret, throwing up after meals, obsessively counting calories. It’s not easy to watch someone you care about damage their health—especially when the solution appears, at least on the outside, to be simple. But eating disorders are more complicated than just unhealthy dietary habits. At their core, they’re attempts to deal with emotional issues and involve distorted, self-critical attitudes about weight, food, and body image. It’s these negative thoughts and feelings that fuel the damaging behaviors.</p><p>People with eating disorders use food to deal with uncomfortable or painful emotions. Restricting food is used to feel in control. Overeating temporarily soothes sadness, anger, or loneliness. Purging is used to combat feelings of helplessness and self-loathing. Over time, people with an eating disorder lose the ability to see themselves objectively and obsessions over food and weight come to dominate everything else in their lives. Their road to recovery begins by identifying the underlying issues that drive their eating disorder and finding healthier ways to cope with emotional pain.</p><p>While you can’t force a person with an eating disorder to change, you can offer your support and encourage treatment. And that can make a huge difference to your loved one’s recovery.</p><p>We can easily prevent such things by avoiding junkfoods and softdrinks, exercising daily, and lastly eating vegetables or fruits.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Narcissistic personality disorder, which is the formal diagnosis that corresponds with the more colloquial term "narcissism", is no different from other personality disorders. It is specifically characterized by an inflated sense of grandiosity or self-importance, entitlement, and a lack of empathy. Most people have all of these characteristics to some extent, but to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, you need to have them to an extreme degree. As an important aside, throughout this article I will use the term "narcissist" to refer to people who are known to have demonstrated high levels of narcissistic traits, even if they were never officially diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder.</p><p></p><p>There are many things that people think of when the words eating disorders are said. Many people do not know what an eating disorder actually is and what actually happenes when you have an eating disorder or how to detect a eating disorder. There are many types of eating disorders but they all have one thing in common, phsycological disorders. The main types of eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, and Bindge eating but are not limited to these. - An eating disorder is a serious health condition involving extremely unhealthy dietary habits. There are a number of accepted eating disorder treatments that depend on the symptoms and severity of the illness. The most effective treatments involve both psychological as well as physical issues with the ultimate goal being a healthy dietary lifestyle.<strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer may vary on what community you live on,</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>For example, You live in this Location XX-XX-XX and this place you live had a lot of beliefs (paniniwala) like saying, "tabi tabi po" whenever you pass by some mound, or their faith if they were religious (if they had a festival or if they had a lot of 'imahen') or their tradition if they had one passed by their old ones and so on (like on how stuffs originated).

It will help you focus and be more creative. Additionally, it enhances agility and self-awareness. Mountaineering has a plethora of advantages.

The disadvantages of mountaineering include the fact that climbers encounter a multitude of risks. Hazards are classified into two types: objective and subjective.

And there are mental as well as physical benefits. “Practicing good body hygiene helps you feel good about yourself, which is important for your mental health,” notes Donald Novey, MD, an integrative medicine physician with the Advocate Medical Group in Park Ridge, Ill. People who have poor hygiene — disheveled hair and clothes, body odor, bad breath, missing teeth, and the like — often are seen as unhealthy and may face discrimination.</p><br />
