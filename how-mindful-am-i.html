“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is, that I know nothing.” 
- (Socrates) Plato, The Republic
“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy
“Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you, perhaps you will 
thenceforth avoid falling ill.”
- Sigmund Freud, Character and Culture
“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”
- Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception</a>

How would you feel if the person who is important to you chose someone else to be with, rather than you who are near to him? I am being selfish if I allow him to be with someone else? I am just being reasonable, I am that bad? Even it hurts me, I chose what he wants. I am okay with it but why he is mad if he wants that? He wasn't minding if I get hurt by asking someone's accompany but what worse is, he is mad because I told him that  he is already with his girl-friend, not Girlfriend. &gt;•&lt; T-T </a>

“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is, that I know nothing.” 
- (Socrates) Plato, The Republic
“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy
“Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you, perhaps you will 
thenceforth avoid falling ill.”
- Sigmund Freud, Character and Culture
“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”
- Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>The speaker followed the THINK </strong>process before he spoke. It is because he was mindful of the possible feelings that the teacher would feel when she hears the words.</p><p></p>Is what I want to say True? (Yes)<p>From the short text given, I can say that the speaker or commenter was true about his words. He honestly said that it does not look that bad after all even if others think differently. </p><br />Is what I want to say Helpful? (Yes)<p>It is really helpful because it can boost the teacher's confidence in showing off her new hair color. She might have been embarrassed by the negative things she heard from the public. The speaker's words are helpful to let her know that there is still someone who thinks differently.<br /><br /></p>Am I the best one to say it? (Yes)<p>I believe that the speaker should be the one to say it to make it more sincere and authentic. The teacher can feel the emotion behind the speaker so it is best to say that he will e the one who should deliver the encouraging words.</p><p></p>Is it necessary to say it Now? (Yes)<p>It is really necessary to say it as soon as possible because the teacher might dye back her hair to its previous color and the speaker does not want to ruin the ambition of the teacher to try new hair color.</p><p></p>Is it Kind to this person and others? (Yes)<p>Showing care and empathy to others is always showing kindness.

                        <p>"I<strong> am learning how to walk away from people and situations that threaten my peace of mind,self respect of my self worth."</strong></p><p>In life, we meet people for a reason. Sometimes, they are meant to stay in our lives. Sometimes, they are meant to just pass by.  Sometimes, they bring us happiness. Sometimes, they bring us pain. And if the latter happens, we lose ourselves. We forget who we are and what we are.  We tend to question our values. We should always be reminded that we have a choice... that sometimes, choosing to walk away from people who cause us pain may be the greatest lesson we could learn and the best decision we could ever have. If you can say that line with confidence, that <strong>means you are finally ready to let go.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
