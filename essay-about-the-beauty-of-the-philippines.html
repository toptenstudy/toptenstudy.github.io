Naranjo  The Philippines is one of the most visited countries in the world. There are numerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.  Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners.  In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous. They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have little. It is their belief that sharing is loving.  Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands and beaches. It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao, Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breathtaking, and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience and delicious local foods to partake and share. Also, the Philippines has a unique culture to learn and appreciate. I cannot deny that I agree with all these thoughts.  In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines. That is why, they continue to visit it and others even choose to stay in the country. ​</a>

Not only one place here has scenic places but every province or city has an ocean which can represent the beauty of it. Begin Here: Opinion 1. They open the door when you get in the cab which is very difficult for a Japanese person to do. 2. Filipinos sing a lot while they are working, and they are very good singers. 3. Filipinos are cheerful and friendly. 4. Women in the Philippines are energetic and can do a lot of things. 5. Fruits in the Philippines are delicious.​</a>

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</a>

Naranjo  The Philippines is one of the most visited countries in the world. There are numerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.  Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners.  In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous. They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have little. It is their belief that sharing is loving.  Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands and beaches. It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao, Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breathtaking, and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience and delicious local foods to partake and share. Also, the Philippines has a unique culture to learn and appreciate. I cannot deny that I agree with all these thoughts.  In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines. That is why, they continue to visit it and others even choose to stay in the country. ​</h2><br />

There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

It can clear out your mind from negativities and stress. Traveling alone is a great idea because you are free to go wherever you want and do whatever you would like to do. When you are alone, you don't have somebody to compromise with and no baggage to deal with. If you are alone, you can decide for yourself and you can take charge of your money well. One can even make friends while traveling especially if you chose to stay on an island and go resort or bar hopping. If your purpose is to find yourself and purpose, then being alone is  a perfect idea. You will have all the moment to yourself. You will be able to meditate and reflect on what's going with your life. Who knows, while doing it, you can find the answers and solutions to your problems or find the one that you've been looking for. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
