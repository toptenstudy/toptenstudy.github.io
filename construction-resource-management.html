Women are mostly in sewing department, packaging and quality control medium size organization. His main concern was preparing the payroll and handling employee’s records.	The Human resource department is composed of 5 employees a payroll clerk, a personnel assistant and two supervisors and Bong Si as manager . The record of Bong Si in his academic achievements is quietly satisfactory. His bachelor’s degree is in the field of engineering. Performance in the previous employment is quite satisfactory. The construction company of his previous employment closed shop due to an economic slowdown, this cause his separation from employment.	The garment business is globally competitive, and customer’s satisfaction is of prime importance. Employee’s commitments to performance standard are high priority. In the three-month span of Mr. Bong Si employment, 20 percent of women employees and 12 percent of male employees resigned for unknown reasons, as there was no exit interview conducted. Production schedule was delayed, and foreign customers were alarmed. 	The general manager Mario Mabilangan, called Rod santos regarding the problem. He noted Rod’s indecisive approach to the HR problem and actions that he failed to take. He pointed out to Bong Si that he exactly did not know what to do regarding the current situation. His subordinates began to complain to Mr. Habibi about Bong Si indecision.	Bong Si became more withdrawn from his subordinates and other managers in the plant. He showed little interest in his job and concentrated in mental jobs concerning the department. In general, he lost control of his job on managing the department.​</a>

Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Estimate costs<p></p><p>The first step towards managing your project finances is to estimate the costs. This isn’t as easy as it sounds. You need to forecast the total amount of people, equipment, materials and other resources needed to complete the work. You then need to estimate the costs of these resources and when these expenses will take place.</p><p></p>2. Set the budget<p></p><p>Estimating the costs is not the same as setting your budget. The budget shows how the money is allocated according to your company’s financial rules. The budget shows the expense accounts, allocates capital versus expense dollars, shows when funds are allocated to your project, etc. Ultimately you need to manage project costs according to the budget.</p><p></p>3. Determine if you can get contingency funding<p></p><p>Project estimates are rarely 100% accurate. A contingency represents the estimating uncertainly. A contingency budget represents this estimating uncertainty. For example, if you estimated your project to be 100,000 with a 90% confidence, you could also ask for a 10,000 contingency budget to represent the uncertainty. This 10,000 is not used for risks or scope change requests. It can be tapped if it turns out you underestimated work on your project. Not all organizations allow contingency budgets. If you do not have this budget flexibility you can add the uncertainly factor back into your baseline estimate.</p><p></p>4. Track weekly<p></p><p>The next step is to start tracking your spending on the project. You need to track every expense – human resources and physical resources This could be a manual process but is usually handled by your accounting system. Ask your team to complete expense forms and submit them to you for approval when they spend money on behalf of the project. You need to pre-approve any large expenses before they are incurred so you can more easily control expenditures on the project.</p><p></p><p>Cash flow management is about managing the cash needed to deliver your project. Make sure your Sponsor has approved the next 1-2 months of work ahead of time, and that the funds needed to manage the project have been made available. Then track the spending of that funding every week.</p><p></p>5. Manage expectations<p></p><p>Report the true status of your spending and your forecasted spending. If you are at risk of going under budget or over budget, be sure to manage expectations so that there are no surprises.</p><p></p><p>Managing costs on a project can be difficult.

Case Study Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. is the leading wholesale distributor of construction supplies in the Philippines, and one of the country's largest distributors of hardware equipment, tools, and other interior and exterior building commodities and related products.

The business venture reached over P50 billion sales and has existing four ISO certifications, certificates which issued to companies with enhanced quality management system. It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</h2><br />
