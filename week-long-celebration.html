                                            Nena's Diary On November 14, 2019, we celebrated the start of our annual foundation week. Many games and contests were held, and the prizes were amazing. There were also booths to visit and enjoy. The next day, we had a program where teachers and pupils showcased their talents. It was exhilarating. On the third day, a mass was held on our school's multi-purpose hall in the morning. Later on, we had out sports fest where my friends and I actively participated. It was such a wonderful experience. On the day before the end of the week-long celebration, our school had a community service through tree planting and cleaning drive. Finally, on the last day of celebration, we had the awarding ceremony. I was so happy and relieved for I I could rest after all the activities. I also thanked God for I learned many things and expanded my circle of friends. Question: Did Nena enjoy their annual foundation week?
