Analog multimeters are test equipment for measuring resistance, which is relatively cheap, and offer a reasonably good level of accuracy and general performance. (True or False) __4. When measuring resistance values in a circuit, it is necessary to make sure that any capacitors in the circuit are not attached to the circuitry. (True or False)__5. The meters are zero' ed done by firmly placing the two probes together to give a short circuit and then adjusting the zero control to give zero ohms reading.__6. The meters are zero' ed because the full-scale deflection will change according to aspects such as the state of the battery.__7. A meter that indicates low resistance corresponding to high current has its needle settles on the left-hand side of the dial.__8. By measuring the resistance, it is possible to determine the resistance between the two probes of the multimeter, or other items of test equipment.__9. The multimeter is an ideal piece of test equipment for measuring resistance.__10. Resistor values are often indicated with color codes, and all leaded resistors with a power rating up to one watt are marked with color bands.​</a>

Write: A if only the statement in Column A is TRUE. B if only the statement in Column B is TRUE. Each item is worth 2 points. COLUMN A Only new knowledge can be considered research. A researcher must always adhere to the ethical codes and policies of research. Research is systematic if it follows certain process or standards. Our usual and personal process of conducting inquiry and problem solving becomes research if it is published in books or journals. Quantitative research is usually concerned with generating hypothesis from data rather than testing a hypothesis. Qualitative research is time consuming and more difficult to analyze. Research is objective if it employs appropriate methods to produce evidence-based information. C if the statements on both columns are TRUE. D if the statements on both columns are FALSE. The Design and Planning Stage involves developing the research framework and determining the research purpose and objective. All significant factors like time, budget and access to resources must be analyzed to determine if the research can be done. Variable is any characteristic that can have different values or traits across research participants. COLUMN B Research explores the culture of the people. Plagiarism is the act of illegally using another person's ideas, works, processes and results. Quantitative research uses small sizes chosen purposely. The researcher must post the names of the research participants and their personal information to avoid being selected by another researcher. Qualitative research provides more detailed information to explain complex issues. Qualitative research follows a deductive procedure. A case study focuses merely on the nature of the story told by the participants. Ethical norms guarantee the public that researchers are deemed responsible for committing any form of research misconduct. The purpose of collecting data in research is to gather information on obsolete and outdated data. The researcher needs to use comprehensive language to present information and convey explanation throughout the research process.​</a>

It focuses on the "why" rather than the "what" of social phenomena and relies on the direct experiences of human beings as meaning-making agents in their every day lives. Rather than by logical and statistical procedures, qualitative researchers use multiple systems of inquiry for the study of human phenomena including biography, case study, historical analysis, discourse analysis, ethnography, grounded theory, and phenomenology.</p><p></p><p>8.While narrative analysis as a genre of interpretation includes several different frameworks, there are four typical narrative forms of analyses that may be used in concert with one another in a given study: structural, functional, thematic, and dialogic/performance.</p><p></p><p>9.Phenomenological Study  Aims to find the essence or structure of an experience by explaining how complex meanings are built out of simple units of inner experience, for example, the essence of being a participant in a particular program or the essence of understanding a subject.</p><p></p><p>10.Causal Design. Causality studies may be thought of as understanding a phenomenon in terms of conditional statements in the form, “If X, then Y.” This type of research is used to measure what impact a specific change will have on existing norms and assumptions.</p><p></p><p>11.</p><p></p><p>12.A cohort study is a type of longitudinal research that samples a cohort (a group of people with a shared characteristic) while doing a cross-section at specific time intervals.</p><p></p><p>13.</p><p></p><p>14.There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.</p><p></p><p>15.</p><br />

B if only the statement in Column B is TRUE. Each item is worth 2 points. COLUMN A Only new knowledge can be considered research. A researcher must always adhere to the ethical codes and policies of research. Research is systematic if it follows certain process or standards. Our usual and personal process of conducting inquiry and problem solving becomes research if it is published in books or journals. Quantitative research is usually concerned with generating hypothesis from data rather than testing a hypothesis. Qualitative research is time consuming and more difficult to analyze. Research is objective if it employs appropriate methods to produce evidence-based information. C if the statements on both columns are TRUE. D if the statements on both columns are FALSE. The Design and Planning Stage involves developing the research framework and determining the research purpose and objective. All significant factors like time, budget and access to resources must be analyzed to determine if the research can be done. Variable is any characteristic that can have different values or traits across research participants. COLUMN B Research explores the culture of the people. Plagiarism is the act of illegally using another person's ideas, works, processes and results. Quantitative research uses small sizes chosen purposely. The researcher must post the names of the research participants and their personal information to avoid being selected by another researcher. Qualitative research provides more detailed information to explain complex issues. Qualitative research follows a deductive procedure. A case study focuses merely on the nature of the story told by the participants. Ethical norms guarantee the public that researchers are deemed responsible for committing any form of research misconduct. The purpose of collecting data in research is to gather information on obsolete and outdated data. The researcher needs to use comprehensive language to present information and convey explanation throughout the research process.​</h2><br />
