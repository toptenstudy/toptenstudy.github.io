                                            While mingling with friends at a party, you mention a recent promotion that has placed you in charge of evaluating bids for a large computer hardware contract. A few days later, you and your significant other receive an invitation to dinner at the home of a couple you know slightly who were also at the party. Over cocktails, the conversation turns to the contract you’re managing. Your host seems remarkably well-informed about the bidding process and likely bidders. You volunteer information about the potential value of the contract and briefly outline the criteria your firm will use to select the winner. At the end of the evening, he surprises you when he reveals that he is a consultant currently working for several of the companies active in this market. Later that night your mind is racing. Did you reveal the information that can provide one of the suppliers with competitive advantage? What are the potential business risks and ethical issues that this situation raises? Should you report the conversation to someone? If so, to whom and what would you say?​</a>

                                            What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</a>

The fact that electronic computers are now used for data processing has led the general public to believe that it is a mysterious, complicated science and that the computers are giant brains. Both of these ideas are false. A computer is basically just a high-speed adding machine that performs the functions it is told to. If the input data are varied even a little, the computer is unable to operate until it is programmed to accept the variations. The business operations it performs are impressive only because of the extremely high speed of manipulation, but most of these operations have been used for decades. Unlike man, the computer performs repetitive calculations without getting tired or bored.a. A computer is a high-speed adding machine.b. A computer is a mysterious giant brain.c. A computer is impressive because of its high speed.d. A computer is superior to man in many ways.2. In earlier days those who had overseas business which they believed should be discussed personally, took ship and set out across the briny deep. Once aboard they transacted their affairs, engaging in commercial and social matters or conducting government business. Today ships and passengers continue to sail the seven seas, and airplanes soar overhead. But above them all, words speed through the sky – telephone conversations quickly bring together in the most personal fashion people who are separated by thousands of miles.a. Overseas telephone service today is ruling out all need for overseas travel.b. Nothing can take the place of person-to-person conversation in settling business, social, and government problems.c. Many conversations which once required overseas travel can now be conducted by telephone.d. Even with modern overseas telephone service people continue to travel abroad by ship or by plane.3. The attitudes of Americans toward gambling are amazingly contradictory.

Gambling laws are inconsistent from state to state or even from town to town and are very difficult to enforce.a. Americans have negative attitudes toward gambling.b. Gambling laws are difficult to enforcec. Gambling laws are inconsistent from community to community.d. Churches do not have uniform ideas about gambling.4. Tea is the world’s second most popular drink after water. Tea is a big part of the Chinese culture.

A few days later, you and your significant other receive an invitation to dinner at the home of a couple you know slightly who were also at the party. Over cocktails, the conversation turns to the contract you’re managing. Your host seems remarkably well-informed about the bidding process and likely bidders. You volunteer information about the potential value of the contract and briefly outline the criteria your firm will use to select the winner. At the end of the evening, he surprises you when he reveals that he is a consultant currently working for several of the companies active in this market. Later that night your mind is racing. Did you reveal the information that can provide one of the suppliers with competitive advantage? What are the potential business risks and ethical issues that this situation raises? Should you report the conversation to someone? If so, to whom and what would you say?​</h2><br />

                            15. What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight

If the input data are varied even a little, the computer is unable to operate until it is programmed to accept the variations.

Gambling laws are difficult to enforcec. Gambling laws are inconsistent from community to community.d. Churches do not have uniform ideas about gambling.4. Tea is the world’s second most popular drink after water. Tea is a big part of the Chinese culture.
