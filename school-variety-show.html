School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.

Then, on the space provided before the number, write N if the paragraph isNarrative, E if Expository, P if Persuasive and EX if Explanatory.1. School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.
