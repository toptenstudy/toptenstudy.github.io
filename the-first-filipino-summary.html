If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</a>

It is guaranteed by the Constitution,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a Palace briefing. Cruz-Angeles made the statement after a Palace reporter asked her “how much of a concern is disinformation to the Marcos administration.” The reporter raised the question, noting that some critics purportedly believed that the supposed disinformation helped “boost” the presidential campaign of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. who enjoyed a landslide win in the May 9, 2022 elections. Responding to the query, Cruz-Angeles said: “People can say that. People can talk about it. They can discuss these matters. But no such wrongdoing has been committed.” Cruz-Angeles added that a complaint may be filed before the proper courts if there is a commission of an “illegal act.” “If any illegal acts have been committed, the proper venue for that would be the courts. So, that's our only reaction here,” she said. Marcos won the May 9 presidential race by a landslide 31,629,783 votes, or more than 15 million votes ahead of second placer presidential candidate Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo. During the presidential campaign, Marcos stuck to his call for Filipinos to unite, saying unity is the key to the country’s recovery from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Marcos, in his first State of the Nation Address delivered on July 25, bared his administration’s foreign policy, as well as plans for economic revitalization and development of the agriculture, agrarian, health, education, infrastructure and energy sectors. Marcos also discussed his government’s initiatives to defeat Covid-19, fight climate change, and protect the welfare of the overseas Filipino workers. (PNA)​</a>

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review.

First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends.

                            17. PAHELP PO PLEASE PA SUMMARY LANG PO PLSThe freedom of speech is prevailing in this country. It is guaranteed by the Constitution,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a Palace briefing. Cruz-Angeles made the statement after a Palace reporter asked her “how much of a concern is disinformation to the Marcos administration.” The reporter raised the question, noting that some critics purportedly believed that the supposed disinformation helped “boost” the presidential campaign of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. who enjoyed a landslide win in the May 9, 2022 elections. Responding to the query, Cruz-Angeles said: “People can say that. People can talk about it. They can discuss these matters. But no such wrongdoing has been committed.” Cruz-Angeles added that a complaint may be filed before the proper courts if there is a commission of an “illegal act.” “If any illegal acts have been committed, the proper venue for that would be the courts. So, that's our only reaction here,” she said. Marcos won the May 9 presidential race by a landslide 31,629,783 votes, or more than 15 million votes ahead of second placer presidential candidate Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo. During the presidential campaign, Marcos stuck to his call for Filipinos to unite, saying unity is the key to the country’s recovery from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Marcos, in his first State of the Nation Address delivered on July 25, bared his administration’s foreign policy, as well as plans for economic revitalization and development of the agriculture, agrarian, health, education, infrastructure and energy sectors. Marcos also discussed his government’s initiatives to defeat Covid-19, fight climate change, and protect the welfare of the overseas Filipino workers. (PNA)​</h2><br />

Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />
