For those with financial challenges, this will offer hape and relief," said Alvere their studies showed that the capsules efficacy against dengue is optimized, Alvero said they can start with the scaled up production of the drug How the program started Before they conducted the clinical trials, Alvero said they first had a program with DOST that started in 2012 where they identified herbal plants that can potentially counteract the mosquito-borne disease. She said the availability of medicinal plants and the lack of treatment against dengue prompted her team to launch this anti-dengue program. in 2012, we evaluated the top health probleme in the country and decided to focus on Dengue because of the magnitude of the problem, the lack of treatmen uptions and the availability of herbal plants that can potentially cure the disease," she said. It was a daunting task for them as it took Alvero's three years to study these herbal plants and developed a medicine in capsule form. After this, they tested the medicine on laboratory rats and then on humans. Data from Department of Health showed that dengue deaths and cases went down by 50% from 49,135 cases and 179 deaths linked to dengue to 21,478 cases and 80 dengue-related deaths reported in the same period in 2021 At this rate. Alvero's team could further decrease dengue cases and deaths in the Philippines. - KBK, GMA News Source: GMA News Online 1. What kind of research source material is the giveninformation? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dengue is a life-threatening disease. It is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito called Aedes. Its bite takes an epidemic form causing a tremendous situation. Dengue is a virus fever originating from Africa. It is a fear in the tropical countries like Bangladesh. Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines etc.</p><p></p><p>Places of laying eggs: Aedes mosquitoes lay their eggs on stagnant water in the well, in the absconded pots, polythene bags, in the holes of a tree where rainwater remains, on the rotten things, on the heap of waste materials etc.</p><p></p><p>Kinds and symptoms of dengue fevers: Dengue fever is of Iwo kinds— classical dengue fever and, hemorrhagic dengue fever. The temperature of classical dengue rises 104–105 celsius. The victim or the patient being attacked with classical dengue fever feels a backache, headache, rashes, and loss of appetite. There is no bleeding in classical dengue fever.</p><p>Don’t Forget to Check: Essay in English</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>But hemorrhagic dengue fever is quite serious than the former. The severe illness is suspected to be due to double infection with the viruses. Other symptoms of DHF include accumulation of reddish spots on the body. The victim always feels pain, loss of appetite, serious headache all over the body and vomiting.</p><p>The WHO guidelines: According to WHO guidelines, if the patient level falls to 15000 or 10000 сmm, a transfusion is necessary. A dengue patient is advised to drink fluids and to take Intravenous saline until the patient’s condition becomes normal. If the fluid volume drop is too low, the patient goes into shock and may die. Shock syndrome occurs when the low volume of blood causes less oxygen to go into the tissue. The patient’s body may get cold and clumsy, blood pressure may fall, and the pulse rate becomes rapid and weak. Bado</p><p></p><p>Prevention: To cure a dengue patient prevention is a better means. The following are the preventive measures to be adopted in this regard. Containers should be covered to prevent mosquitoes and flies from their access and laying eggs.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Both air-conditioner and air cooler need to be kept neat and clean so that mosquitoes cannot take shelter there. The portable water pitchers and containers should be kept upside down. Mosquito bite should be checked by ringing up the curtail or mosquito net or using mosquito repellents.  People should be especially careful about both at morning and at evening.</p><p></p><p>Dengue specialists predict that one-third of the Dhaka households are carrying Aedes mosquitoes breeding space. The city corporation should collect monitoring reports from every household and take special steps against it. Aedes mosquitoes breed mainly in man-made containers like earthen pot, metal drums, plastic containers, used automobile tires and other things in which rainwater remains stagnant.</p><p></p><p>People of all classes should be made alert and awareness should be created among them so that they may keep their home and homesite neat and clean. But in case of a seriously dengue attacked patient, he should immediately be taken to a hospital or health clinic/complex for proper treatment. The first aid can be managed as a primary treatment.</p><p></p><p>Dengue devastation in various places: Dengue devastation has especially be marked in recent years but it had been identified as far back as in 1966. A project is known as Integrated Vector Borne Disease Control Project (I.V.B.D.C.P) supported by WHO detected the dengue virus in Chittagong. Then 25 patients were detected to be seriously attacked with dengue fever.</p><p></p><p>Then in 1977-78, the ICDDRB detected dengue virus in some people in Mohammadpur area. Dengue fever paralyzed the city of Dhaka with fear. The panic, of course, justified was considering that there was no effective care of the disease and that any group was suspicious of it. The whole countrymen were afraid of dengue. oot ar</p><p></p><p>Treatment: Medical science has advanced far in the field of treatment. The dengue attacked patient needs a few tests to diagnosis the nature of dengue fever. The arrangement of first aid should be made. The patient should be encouraged. The serious patient must be hospitalized at an early date.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Mark </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>as </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>brainliest</strong></p><p><strong>Correct</strong><strong> me</strong><strong> if</strong><strong> I'm</strong><strong> </strong><strong>wrong</strong></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>don't </strong><strong>know</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if </strong><strong>that's </strong><strong>8</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>than</strong><strong> </strong><strong>8</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito. There are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Symptoms appear in 3–14 days (average 4–7 days) after the infective bite. Dengue fever is a flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults.</p><p></p><p>There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication but early clinical diagnosis and careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses often save lives.</p><p></p><p>More than 70% of the disease burden is in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the incidence and severity of disease have increased rapidly in recent years. The African and Eastern Mediterranean regions have also recorded more outbreaks of the disease in the last ten years. Since 2010 indigenous transmission of dengue has also been reported in Europe. Urbanization, rapid movement of people and goods, favorable climatic conditions and lack of trained staff have all contributed to the global increase of dengue.</p><br />

For those with financial challenges, this will offer hape and relief," said Alvere their studies showed that the capsules efficacy against dengue is optimized, Alvero said they can start with the scaled up production of the drug How the program started Before they conducted the clinical trials, Alvero said they first had a program with DOST that started in 2012 where they identified herbal plants that can potentially counteract the mosquito-borne disease. She said the availability of medicinal plants and the lack of treatment against dengue prompted her team to launch this anti-dengue program. in 2012, we evaluated the top health probleme in the country and decided to focus on Dengue because of the magnitude of the problem, the lack of treatmen uptions and the availability of herbal plants that can potentially cure the disease," she said. It was a daunting task for them as it took Alvero's three years to study these herbal plants and developed a medicine in capsule form. After this, they tested the medicine on laboratory rats and then on humans. Data from Department of Health showed that dengue deaths and cases went down by 50% from 49,135 cases and 179 deaths linked to dengue to 21,478 cases and 80 dengue-related deaths reported in the same period in 2021 At this rate.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>New scientific insights into dengue vector ecology and disease transmission patterns, together with more targeted use of environmental management strategies, may offer improved potential for combating dengue fever, the world's fastest growing vector-borne disease.</p><p></p><p>Dengue fever, together with associated dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), is the most important vector-borne viral disease affecting humans. Aedes aegypti, the urban yellow fever mosquito, is also the principal dengue-carrying vector. A secondary vector is Aedes albopictus.</p><p></p><p>Aedes aegypti was eliminated from large areas of the Americas as part of the yellow fever mosquito eradication campaign in the 1950s and 1960s, but later reinvaded those areas. Dengue has emerged or re-emerged in Asia, the Americas and elsewhere over the past three decades, and presently occurs in nearly 100 tropical and subtropical countries (1). Epidemics have become progressively larger. In the year 2002, the disease was responsible for an estimated 19 000 deaths, as well as the loss of 616 000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (2).</p><p></p><p>This disease surge is of particular concern since there is no curative treatment for dengue, and in many settings space spray applications of insecticides, or generalized community clean-up campaigns of vector breeding sites have had only a transient and limited effect, if at all, on disease incidence.</p><p></p><p>The resurgence of dengue</p><p>Social and environmental factors – including increased urbanization (particularly of poor populations lacking basic health services) as well as expansion of international travel and trade – are linked to the resurgence of dengue disease (3). Climate change also may affect transmission, as dengue mosquitoes reproduce more quickly and bite more frequently at higher temperatures (4, 5).</p><p></p><p>The epidemiology and ecology of dengue are complicated by the fact that there are four virus serotypes, some or all of which may be circulating in a particular endemic region at a particular time. Within any given local population, levels of immunity to each of the four serotypes may vary over time as a function of natural population growth, past population exposure to other serotypes, etc. Depending on the local level of immunity, therefore, an epidemic may erupt at higher or lower thresholds of vector density.</p><p></p><p>While beginning as a flu-like illness, dengue can develop into a deadly fever (dengue haemorrhagic fever). Unlike most other diseases, sequential infection with different serotypes increases – rather than reduces – the risk of severe illness. Most cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever occur in children under the age of 15.</p><p></p><p>The importance of good environmental management</p><p>In proximity to human settlements, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes breed primarily in artificial water containers, and the mosquito’s life-cycle is closely associated with human activities. Larval habitats are increasing rapidly in urban areas (1). Since there is no curative treatment for dengue, targeted environmental and ecosystem management is increasingly relevant. In many settings, however, generalized community clean-up campaigns or space-spray application of insecticides, have had only a transient and limited effect – or even no measurable effect at all – on disease incidence.</p><br />
