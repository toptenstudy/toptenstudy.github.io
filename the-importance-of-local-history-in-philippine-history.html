                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The most important goal of governance is stability. Subsequently, you can think of governance (or ideas about governance, i.e. the political spectrum) as a brick wall where people, through out time, build it up brick by brick. A lot of “contemporary” concerns and issues determine how each brick is laid, but these concerns and issues are nothing but the “history” for the future, so when you look at the wall as a whole, you mostly see a shape formed by its history.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Hope it helps on you:)❤️✨</p><br />
