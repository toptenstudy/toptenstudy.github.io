                                            During Sara's short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father’s stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.
“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old. “Couldn’t you go to school, too? I would help you with your lessons.”
Write a short paragraph citing evidence from the text to show that Sara does not want to be separated from her father.

                                            Read this fable, The City Mouse and the Country Mouse. Take note of its elements and then evaluate each of them using the complete guide. Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

The father continued, “Did you see how poor people can be?" The boy just said, "Yeah!" The father asked again, "And what did you learn?" The boy answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars; our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon. When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless. The son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!"Ipa brainliest ko ang makasagot ng tama​</a>

                            6. During Sara's short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father’s stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.
“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old. “Couldn’t you go to school, too? I would help you with your lessons.”
Write a short paragraph citing evidence from the text to show that Sara does not want to be separated from her father.

                            16. Read this fable, The City Mouse and the Country Mouse. Take note of its elements and then evaluate each of them using the complete guide. Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

The father continued, “Did you see how poor people can be?" The boy just said, "Yeah!" The father asked again, "And what did you learn?" The boy answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars; our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon. When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless. The son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!"Ipa brainliest ko ang makasagot ng tama​</h2><br />

The road led to a mighty andmajestic place— Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the magnificent array of Englishroyalty. Perhaps, now, he would be able to see a prince of flesh and blood.There were many country folks and people from the city. All at once, he caught sight of aspectacle that almost made him shout out of joy. Within was an attractive-looking boy. He wasclothed in lovely silk and satin, shining with jewels. Several gorgeous gentlemen stood nearhim. Oh! He was a prince without a shadow of a doubt. The prayer of the pauper boy's heartwas answered at last.Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement. His eyes grew big with wonder anddelight. He wanted to have a good, devouring look at the prince. The next instant, one of thesoldiers snatched him rudely away.The soldier said, “Mind your manners, you young beggar!"The crowd jeered and laughed. But the young prince sprang to the gate. He cried out,"How dare you treat a poor boy that way! How dare you treat my father's subject so! Open thegate and let the boy in!”yan po ung unang story​</h2><br />

Host- Miss T<br /><strong>Miss T: </strong>Welcome to Talk-a-Talk TV! Today, we will be inviting
the famous author Anton Chekhov. Anton Pavlovich Chekhov is very known for his
collection of short stories. One of these short stories which is newly
published is the story entitled " A Day in the Country". Anton is a
Russian Playwright, author and a professional physician.<br />
 (audience clap their hands)<br /><strong>Host: Hi</strong> Anton!<br /><strong>Anton: </strong>Hello Miss T, its nice to be here.<br /><strong>Miss T: </strong>Welcome Anton, so can you tell us about your newly
publish story? Everybody here is very eager to know what's the story about.<br /><strong>Anton: </strong>Oh, thank you! Yes, my booklet on my short story "
A Day in the Country" is already out. The story is all about the
relationship of man's life to nature. The story focuses on the two beggars
Danilka and Fyokla, an 8 and a 6 year old beggars and Terenty, the village
cobbler. In the story, these two beggars leaned on the village cobbler. It was
Terenty whom they somewhat entrusted their lives because it was only Terenty
who cared, love and fed them. These two beggars are already orphans. <br /><strong>Miss T:</strong> Oh, how sad. Why did Terenty helped these two? what is
his relationship with them? I mean, why did he help these two orphans/<br /><strong>Anton:</strong> The two beggars are orphans. They have nowhere to go
to. They only have Terenty. It was Terenty whom they asked about their
curiosity in nature. It was Terenty whom they asked assistance in times of
their troubles. Terenty in short, is like a father to them and in return, the
two were like Terenty's children. They have this kind of relationship in the
story.<br /><strong>Miss T:</strong> Oh how amazing! i can't wait to grab my own copy!<br /><strong>Anton:</strong> Aha! I got this for you, and everybody here in the
studio. I hope you will love the story!<br /><strong>Miss T:</strong> Indeed! Thank you so much Anton. Such a wonderful
