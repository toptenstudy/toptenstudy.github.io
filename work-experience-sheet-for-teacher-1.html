                                            General Guidelines 1. The teacher/laboratory technician has the sole authority inside the laboratory. Before using laboratory equipment, ask permission and assistance. Listen carefully to the instructions before performing an experiment. 2. The laboratory is a place where you will gain knowledge. It is not a place for horseplay and other unnecessary activities. 3. Do not eat or drink inside the laboratory. 4. To maintain orderliness, place bags and other materials not to be used in the experiment in a separate location. 5. Wear safety gears such as laboratory gowns and aprons, goggles, masks, and gloves while working in the laboratory. These will protect you from spattering of chemicals and other harmful occurrences. 6. When an accident happens. Report it immediately to the teacher. Dealing with Glassware 1. Handle glassware with care to avoid breaking them. 2. If a glass apparatus is broken, clean it up immediately using a brush and a pan. Rap the broken pieces in a sheet of paper before throwing. This will prevent injury that may happen to the garbage collector 3. Before inserting glass tube or thermometer into a cork or rubber stopper, ask for the technician's supervision.​</a>

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

He thought that atoms were made of a single material formed into different shapes and sizes. The word "(1) ___________ " is derived from the Greek word "atomos" which means "not able to be divided."In 1803, John Dalton, a school teacher, proposed his atomic theory. Dalton's theory states that elements (substances composed of only one type of (2) __________) combine in certain proportions to form (3) __________.In 1897, a British scientist named J. J. Thomson experimented with a cathode-ray tube which had a positively charged plate. The plate attracted negatively charged particles that we now call (4) ____________. Rather than being indivisible particles, Thomson's plum-pudding (or raisin bread) atomic model states that atoms contain (5) ___________ charged electrons embedded within a sea of positive charge.In 1909, Ernest Rutherford conducted an experiment in which he aimed a beam of positively charged particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Most of the particles went straight through the gold foil, some were deflected and others bounced straight back. Because some of the particles bounced straight back, Rutherford was able to show that the center of the atom, the nucleus, is (6)______________ and (7) ______________. The nucleus contains protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which are (8) ______________.In 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish scientist who worked with Dr. Rutherford, proposed that electrons move around the nucleus in certain paths, or energy levels (just like in the solar system where planets move around the sun). This (9) ___________ was improved upon by an Austrian physicist named Erwin Schröedinger and a German physicist named Werner Heisenberg. Schröedinger and Heisenberg proposed that electrons do not move in definite paths around the nucleus, but are be found in regions around the nucleus called electron (10) _____________.​</a>

                            2. General Guidelines 1. The teacher/laboratory technician has the sole authority inside the laboratory. Before using laboratory equipment, ask permission and assistance. Listen carefully to the instructions before performing an experiment. 2. The laboratory is a place where you will gain knowledge. It is not a place for horseplay and other unnecessary activities. 3. Do not eat or drink inside the laboratory. 4. To maintain orderliness, place bags and other materials not to be used in the experiment in a separate location. 5. Wear safety gears such as laboratory gowns and aprons, goggles, masks, and gloves while working in the laboratory. These will protect you from spattering of chemicals and other harmful occurrences. 6. When an accident happens. Report it immediately to the teacher. Dealing with Glassware 1. Handle glassware with care to avoid breaking them. 2. If a glass apparatus is broken, clean it up immediately using a brush and a pan. Rap the broken pieces in a sheet of paper before throwing.

They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter.

                            8. Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why?4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />

Ito po yung pag pipilian ng mga sagot:NEGATIVELYCHARGED PARTICLESNEUTRALATOMMODELVERY SMALLCLOUDSPROTIONCOMPOUNDATOMELECTRONS A Greek philosopher named Democritus said that all atoms are small, hard particles. He thought that atoms were made of a single material formed into different shapes and sizes. The word "(1) ___________ " is derived from the Greek word "atomos" which means "not able to be divided."In 1803, John Dalton, a school teacher, proposed his atomic theory. Dalton's theory states that elements (substances composed of only one type of (2) __________) combine in certain proportions to form (3) __________.In 1897, a British scientist named J. J. Thomson experimented with a cathode-ray tube which had a positively charged plate. The plate attracted negatively charged particles that we now call (4) ____________. Rather than being indivisible particles, Thomson's plum-pudding (or raisin bread) atomic model states that atoms contain (5) ___________ charged electrons embedded within a sea of positive charge.In 1909, Ernest Rutherford conducted an experiment in which he aimed a beam of positively charged particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Most of the particles went straight through the gold foil, some were deflected and others bounced straight back. Because some of the particles bounced straight back, Rutherford was able to show that the center of the atom, the nucleus, is (6)______________ and (7) ______________. The nucleus contains protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which are (8) ______________.In 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish scientist who worked with Dr. Rutherford, proposed that electrons move around the nucleus in certain paths, or energy levels (just like in the solar system where planets move around the sun). This (9) ___________ was improved upon by an Austrian physicist named Erwin Schröedinger and a German physicist named Werner Heisenberg. Schröedinger and Heisenberg proposed that electrons do not move in definite paths around the nucleus, but are be found in regions around the nucleus called electron (10) _____________.​</h2><br />
