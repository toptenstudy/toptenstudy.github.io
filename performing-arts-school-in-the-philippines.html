Write an outline of the research findings based from the conclusion below. &quot;Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines&quot; by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</p>

Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</a>

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</h2><br />

                            15. B Directions Compare and contrast how Cambodia and Myanmar preserve their respective cultures. Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</h2><br />
