                                            In science class, the students are going to build and launch rockets. Before they start actually building the rockets, each student in the class has to submit a two-dimensional scale drawing of the rocket they want to build and write a paper over why they chose that design. Jameson's drawing of the rocket he wants to build is shown below.
Note: figure not drawn to scale.
In Jameson's drawing, the nose cone has an area of 
 square inches, each of the fins has an area of 
 square inches, and the total area of the drawn rocket is 
 square inches.</a>

                                            The development of agriculture marked a change in how people lived. With the growth of agriculture, men lived close to each other and later organized themselves into villages where they gradually settled permanently. As they developed their living conditions and culture, a more complex way of life emerged. These are called civilizations.What makes a civilization?Design your civilization and draw it on a piece of paper. Take note that your civilization existed sometime between 3000 - 5000 years ago.

Write your answer on theblank space provided.6 General Assembly drawing is the most common type of assembly drawing. All parts are drawn intheir working position showing the general arrangement of the components, how the parts fittogether with all of its components located and identified.7. There are two distinctive types of working drawings, the Detail and Assembly drawings8. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easilyand clearly understood, and standard conversions and units are used9. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relativeposition of each part and the functional relationship among various components.10. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketchform11. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all thenecessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project12. In the General Assembly drawing, all parts must be drawn in their operating position with all of itscomponents located and identified.13. In the General Assembly drawing, the number of views can be one, two, three or more as neededbut it should be minimum.14. A good viewing direction is that represents all (ar most) of the parts assembled in their workingposition either in orthographic or pictorial view,15. General assembly drawings may contain notes on manufacturing processes required forassembly, balloons to indicate item numbers and parts list or bill of materials.​</a>

Materials: Grid paper, Philippine new coins (1, 5 and 10 peso coins), ruler, and pen.
Procedures:
A. Center (0,0)
1. Use the grid paper below and draw 3 sets of Cartesian coordinate plane. Use
1 unit in labelling the x- and y- axes.
2. Locate the center (0,0) of each 3 sets of Cartesian plane by putting a visible
dots.
3. Place each coin (designated set) at the center or on the dot in each Cartesian
plane. Using pen, draw a circle by tracing the circumference (edge) of the
each coin.
4. After you draw, remove the coins. From the center (dot), draw a line to any
point of the circle.
5. Get your ruler, measure in centimeters the line (radius) you created in each
Cartesian plane and record the values.
6. Solve the equation of each circle using the obtained value of the radius.
7. Compare the equation obtained and make an observation note of the activity</a>

In science class, the students are going to build and launch rockets. Before they start actually building the rockets, each student in the class has to submit a two-dimensional scale drawing of the rocket they want to build and write a paper over why they chose that design. Jameson's drawing of the rocket he wants to build is shown below.
Note: figure not drawn to scale.
In Jameson's drawing, the nose cone has an area of 
square inches, each of the fins has an area of 
square inches, and the total area of the drawn rocket is 
square inches.</a>

                        <p></p><p>Jameson's paper should explain why this design is his choice for the rocket and will likely focus on several factors. He may choose to discuss the aerodynamics of the rocket such as the size and shape of the nose cone and fins, how he believes this design will affect the flight path of the rocket, and the stability of the rocket itself. He may also explain why he chose to leave the body of the rocket between the fins empty and why the fins are the size and shape they are, as these choices will greatly affect the performance of the rocket. Additionally, he should discuss other factors such as how much performance he is expecting from his rocket, what materials he plans to use, and how each design choice he has made fits into his overall vision for the rocket.</p><br />

                            5. The development of agriculture marked a change in how people lived. With the growth of agriculture, men lived close to each other and later organized themselves into villages where they gradually settled permanently. As they developed their living conditions and culture, a more complex way of life emerged. These are called civilizations.What makes a civilization?Design your civilization and draw it on a piece of paper. Take note that your civilization existed sometime between 3000 - 5000 years ago.

Write your answer on theblank space provided.6 General Assembly drawing is the most common type of assembly drawing. All parts are drawn intheir working position showing the general arrangement of the components, how the parts fittogether with all of its components located and identified.7. There are two distinctive types of working drawings, the Detail and Assembly drawings8. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easilyand clearly understood, and standard conversions and units are used9. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relativeposition of each part and the functional relationship among various components.10. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketchform11. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all thenecessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project12. In the General Assembly drawing, all parts must be drawn in their operating position with all of itscomponents located and identified.13. In the General Assembly drawing, the number of views can be one, two, three or more as neededbut it should be minimum.14. A good viewing direction is that represents all (ar most) of the parts assembled in their workingposition either in orthographic or pictorial view,15. General assembly drawings may contain notes on manufacturing processes required forassembly, balloons to indicate item numbers and parts list or bill of materials.​</h2><br />

In science class, the students are going to build and launch rockets. Before they start actually building the rockets, each student in the class has to submit a two-dimensional scale drawing of the rocket they want to build and write a paper over why they chose that design. Jameson's drawing of the rocket he wants to build is shown below.
Note: figure not drawn to scale.
In Jameson's drawing, the nose cone has an area of 
square inches, each of the fins has an area of 
square inches, and the total area of the drawn rocket is 
square inches.</h2><br />
