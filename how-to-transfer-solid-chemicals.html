                                            Activity 3 Directions: Arrange the procedure on how to weigh out a sample of a solid for use in quantitative analysis by placing the number 1-10before the number item. _______Subtract the weight of the 'empty' weighing containers from that of the weighing container plus sample and you now know the mass of chemical, to an accuracy of four decimal places, which has been transferred into your volumetric flask, beaker or conical flask. _______Weigh out the calculated amount of chemical within the accuracy of the balance. _______Check the zero reading on the analytical balance by pressing the bar/button with the balance doors closed. ________Relock the balance pan by pressing the bar/button. ________Carefully transfer the weighing boat or sample tube to the balance pan of the analytical balance (for very accurate work use tweezers or the tongs since the sweat from your fingers will contribute to the weight recorded) and close the balance door. ________Release the balance pan by pressing the bar/button, allow the balance to stabilize and record the weight of the chemical and container. If the last decimal place 'cycles' between two or three numbers, determine the mid-point of the 'cycle' and record this value as the weight. ________Lock the balance pan by pressing the bar/button, remove the sample container and transfer the solid to your volumetric flask, beaker or conical flask by pouring, but do not wet the weighing boat or sample tube with solvent. _______Replace the weighing container on the analytical balance pan, close the balance door and weigh if the last decimal place 'cycles' and record this value as the weight of the 'empty' weighing container. _______Lock the balance pan by pressing the bar/button and remove the weighing container from the balance. _______Subtract the weight of the 'empty' weighing containers from that of the weighing container plus sample and you now know the mass of chemical, to an accuracy of four decimal places, which has been transferred into your volumetric flask, beaker or conical flask.Helppp! ​</a>

Ta pour out the less dense substance. 5. If an ail spill spotted along the shoreline of your area, what process can you suggest to separate oil from water? A.l will suggest using distillation to purify oil from water. B. I will suggest using decantation to separate oil from water. C. I will suggest using filtration to filter the oil from water. D. I will suggest using sieving by letting the mixture pass through a sieve or strainer. 6. The following are reasons why do we need to remove the oil spill quickly, except one. A Because they poilute the water. B. Because they can cause sickness to plants and animals C. Because they are expensive. D. Because they can cause sickness to people around the area. 7. What are you going to do to have purified water that is safe to drink? A Use distillation process. B. Get water from the faucet C. Use evaporation. D. Use filtration process 8.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.What is the process of photosynthesis?</p><p><strong>During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose.</strong></p><p></p><p>2.How do cells divide and replicate?</p><p><strong>During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells. Because this process is so critical, the steps of mitosis are carefully controlled by certain genes. When mitosis is not regulated correctly, health problems such as cancer can result.</strong></p><p></p><p>3.What is the nature of light and how does it travel?</p><p><strong>Light is the narrow visible band of radiation in the broad continuous electromagnetic spectrum that ranges from radio waves to gamma rays. Its nature is complex as it transfers energy, but has no mass. It travels at very high speeds (299,800,000 m/s in the vacuum of interstellar space).</strong></p><p></p><p>4.What is the structure of an atom and what are its components?</p><p><strong>An atom is a complex arrangement of negatively charged electrons arranged in defined shells about a positively charged nucleus. This nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is composed of protons and neutrons (except for common hydrogen which has only one proton). All atoms are roughly the same size.</strong></p><p></p><p>5.What is the role of enzymes in chemical reactions?</p><p><strong>Enzymes in our bodies are catalysts that speed up reactions by helping to lower the activation energy needed to start a reaction. Each enzyme molecule has a special place called the active site where another molecule, called the substrate, fits.</strong></p><p></p><p>6.What are the different forms of energy and how are they converted and transferred?</p><p><strong>Chemical energy can be converted to electrical energy. Thermal energy can be converted to heat energy. Mechanical energy can be converted to electrical energy, potential energy, etc. Nuclear energy can be converted to light energy and heat energy.</strong></p><p></p><p>7.What are the characteristics of life and how do they differ from non-living things?</p><p><strong>Living things have three main traits: They grow, take in nutrients (that means food and water), and reproduce (which means they make more living things like themselves). Non-living things do not grow, need nutrients or reproduce.</strong></p><p></p><p>8.How do plants and animals adapt to their environment?</p><p><strong>This happens by the process of natural selection. By natural selection, the nature of the species gradually changes to become adapted to the niche. If a species becomes very well adapted to its environment, and if the environment does not change, species can exist for a very long time before they become extinct.</strong></p><p></p><p>9.What is the process of evolution and how does it occur?</p><p><strong>Evolution reflects the adaptations of organisms to their changing environments and can result in altered genes, novel traits, and new species. Evolutionary processes depend on both changes in genetic variability and changes in allele frequencies over time. The study of evolution can be performed on different scales.</strong></p><p></p><p>10.What are the properties of gases, liquids, and solids and how do they differ?</p><p><strong>A solid has definite volume and shape, a liquid has a definite volume but no definite shape, and a gas has neither a definite volume nor shape. The change from solid to liquid usually does not significantly change the volume of a substance.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Here </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>go </strong></p><p><strong>pa </strong><strong>br</strong><strong>ainiest </strong><strong>po</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Basic Ozone Layer Science</p><p>The Earth's ozone layer protects all life from the sun's harmful radiation, but human activities have damaged this shield. Less ozone-layer protection from ultraviolet (UV) light will, over time, damage crops and lead to higher skin cancer and cataract rates.</p><p></p><p>. The Ozone Layer</p><p>The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers. The lowest layer, the troposphere, extends from the Earth's surface up to about 6 miles or 10 kilometers (km) in altitude. Virtually all human activities occur in the troposphere. Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain on the planet, is only about 5.6 miles (9 km) high. The next layer, the stratosphere, continues from 6 miles (10 km) to about 31 miles (50 km). Most commercial airplanes fly in the lower part of the stratosphere.</p><p></p><p>Most atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a layer in the stratosphere, about 9 to 18 miles (15 to 30 km) above the Earth's surface (see the figure below). Ozone is a molecule that contains three oxygen atoms. At any given time, ozone molecules are constantly formed and destroyed in the stratosphere. The total amount has remained relatively stable during the decades that it has been measured.</p><p></p><br />
