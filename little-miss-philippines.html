</p><p>4. My father, Isko, goes to the market to buy vegetables for our lunch.
</p><p>Answer: Appositive
</p><p>5. Jean sends a gift for her mother on her 50th birthday ..​
</p><p>Answer: Indirect object</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>In grammar, a subject complement or predicative of the subject is a predicative expression that follows a linking verb and that complements the subject of the sentence by either renaming it or describing it. It completes the meaning of the subject.
Subject is  person or thing that is being discussed, described, or dealt with.
An appositive is a noun or pronoun — often with modifiers — set beside another noun or pronoun to explain or identify it.
A direct object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb. An indirect object is a noun or pronoun that receives the direct object. Indirect objects are only found in sentences that also have direct objects. Sentence structure is important to finding direct and indirect objects.<p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />
