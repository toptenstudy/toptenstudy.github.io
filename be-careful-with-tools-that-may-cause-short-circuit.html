                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>One of the things that could cause short circuit inside computers are <strong>faulty computer wires</strong> on its inside parts. Inside the <strong>CPU</strong>, especially on the motherboard, there are parts that needs to be wired using <strong>IDE</strong> or <strong>SATA</strong> <strong>Cables</strong> to connect parts to the motherboard. If these wires are loosely or wrongly attached to the board, you can expect short circuits or other damages as well. To prevent this from happening, ensure that the wires are correctly attached to the board and the wires.<p></p>To know more about Computer Tools, read the following:<p></p>Computer Hardware Diagnostic Tools<p>— https://brainly.ph/question /877890</p><p></p>Computer Tools &amp; Equipment<p>— https://brainly.ph/question/2305343</p><p></p>Why is Computer considered as a Teachers’ Tool?<p>— https://brainly.ph /question/1440619</p><br />
