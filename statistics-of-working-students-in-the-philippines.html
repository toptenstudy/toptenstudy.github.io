This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review.

                                            Nanindigan si Viernes na abot-kamay na ang pagbangon ng ekonomiya ng bansa, lalo pa’t bumaba muli ang antas ng underemployment nitong Hunyo. Umaasa siya na ito rin ang hahantong sa paglago ng mga de-kalidad na trabaho na tutugon sa pangangailangan ng bawat manggagawang Pilipino. Bukod sa kakarampot na sahod na kanilang natatanggap, hindi nila magagamit ang kanilang mga kakayahan at natapos na edukasyon sa angkop na mga trabaho. Inaasahan ni Pabloco na ipatutupad ng administrasyong Marcos ang pagbibigay ng mga serbisyo at pagsasanay sa pagpapadali ng trabaho. Nais din niyang makita na ang buwis na binabayaran ng mga tao ay napupunta sa mga makabuluhang programa at hakbangin para sa ikabubuti ng sektor ng paggawa. Sa huli, nasa administrasyon ng gobyerno na ayusin ang sistemang patuloy na nananakit sa mga manggagawang Pilipino. Tunay na iba ang pasanin ng mga underemployed na manggagawa sa pagbabago ng klima ng ekonomiya sa bansa. Habang pabigat at pabigat ang pasanin na dulot ng pandemya at tumataas ang presyo ng mga serbisyo at bilihin, hindi matatakasan ng mga Pilipino ang realidad ng kawalan ng kapanatagan sa trabaho. Si Joshua Luz, isang working student, ay nagpahayag sa APP ng kanyang pagkadismaya sa estado ng pagkakaroon ng trabaho. Inihayag ni Viernes na ito ang pangalawang pinakamababang ulat ng underemployment mula noong Abril 2005. Ang manipestasyong ito ay nagsabing nagpapakita ng isang optimistikong estado sa sektor ng paggawa. Gayunpaman, hindi maikakaila na patuloy itong bumababa dahil sa pagtaas ng bilang ng mga underemployed. Bawat manggagawang Pilipino ay patuloy na nakikipagsapalaran sa mga hamon ng buhay upang malampasan ang araw-araw na pagsubok na dulot ng malaking gastusin, lalo na sa mga pangunahing pangangailangan. Ito aniya ang nagtutulak sa mga Pilipino na pasukin ang anumang trabahong maaari nilang tanggapin at mabigyan ng serbisyo. Nanawagan si Luz sa administrasyong Marcos na magkaroon ng puso na may layuning tumugon sa pasanin sa paggawa ng mga Pilipino. Ibinahagi ni DOLE Acting Supervising Labor and Employment Officer Sean Pablico sa APP, ang mga programang inilunsad nila upang malutas ang problema. Ang PESO ay nagbibigay ng career guidance at coaching, ebalwasyon ng kanilang mga kakayahan, at pagtalakay sa ninanais na karera sa trabaho.Nangunguna ang Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) sa pagkolekta at pagsusuri ng mahahalagang datos sa sektor ng paggawa sa bansa. Batay sa datos ng Labor Force Survey noong Hunyo 2022, nakapagtala ang ahensya ng 46.59 milyong Pilipino na may trabaho at tinatayang 12.6% sa kanila ay underemployed.magbigay ng dalawang talata kung paano ito masosolusyonan​</a>

                                            Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

                            9. Nanindigan si Viernes na abot-kamay na ang pagbangon ng ekonomiya ng bansa, lalo pa’t bumaba muli ang antas ng underemployment nitong Hunyo. Umaasa siya na ito rin ang hahantong sa paglago ng mga de-kalidad na trabaho na tutugon sa pangangailangan ng bawat manggagawang Pilipino. Bukod sa kakarampot na sahod na kanilang natatanggap, hindi nila magagamit ang kanilang mga kakayahan at natapos na edukasyon sa angkop na mga trabaho. Inaasahan ni Pabloco na ipatutupad ng administrasyong Marcos ang pagbibigay ng mga serbisyo at pagsasanay sa pagpapadali ng trabaho. Nais din niyang makita na ang buwis na binabayaran ng mga tao ay napupunta sa mga makabuluhang programa at hakbangin para sa ikabubuti ng sektor ng paggawa. Sa huli, nasa administrasyon ng gobyerno na ayusin ang sistemang patuloy na nananakit sa mga manggagawang Pilipino. Tunay na iba ang pasanin ng mga underemployed na manggagawa sa pagbabago ng klima ng ekonomiya sa bansa. Habang pabigat at pabigat ang pasanin na dulot ng pandemya at tumataas ang presyo ng mga serbisyo at bilihin, hindi matatakasan ng mga Pilipino ang realidad ng kawalan ng kapanatagan sa trabaho. Si Joshua Luz, isang working student, ay nagpahayag sa APP ng kanyang pagkadismaya sa estado ng pagkakaroon ng trabaho. Inihayag ni Viernes na ito ang pangalawang pinakamababang ulat ng underemployment mula noong Abril 2005. Ang manipestasyong ito ay nagsabing nagpapakita ng isang optimistikong estado sa sektor ng paggawa. Gayunpaman, hindi maikakaila na patuloy itong bumababa dahil sa pagtaas ng bilang ng mga underemployed. Bawat manggagawang Pilipino ay patuloy na nakikipagsapalaran sa mga hamon ng buhay upang malampasan ang araw-araw na pagsubok na dulot ng malaking gastusin, lalo na sa mga pangunahing pangangailangan. Ito aniya ang nagtutulak sa mga Pilipino na pasukin ang anumang trabahong maaari nilang tanggapin at mabigyan ng serbisyo. Nanawagan si Luz sa administrasyong Marcos na magkaroon ng puso na may layuning tumugon sa pasanin sa paggawa ng mga Pilipino. Ibinahagi ni DOLE Acting Supervising Labor and Employment Officer Sean Pablico sa APP, ang mga programang inilunsad nila upang malutas ang problema. Ang PESO ay nagbibigay ng career guidance at coaching, ebalwasyon ng kanilang mga kakayahan, at pagtalakay sa ninanais na karera sa trabaho.Nangunguna ang Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) sa pagkolekta at pagsusuri ng mahahalagang datos sa sektor ng paggawa sa bansa. Batay sa datos ng Labor Force Survey noong Hunyo 2022, nakapagtala ang ahensya ng 46.59 milyong Pilipino na may trabaho at tinatayang 12.6% sa kanila ay underemployed.magbigay ng dalawang talata kung paano ito masosolusyonan​</h2><br />

Sa pamamagitan ng mga programang tulad ng tax incentives at mga negosyong may kaugnayan sa mga lokal na produkto at serbisyo, maaaring makatulong ang pamahalaan sa pagpapalago ng mga trabaho na magbibigay ng de-kalidad na sahod at benepisyo sa mga manggagawang Pilipino.</p><br />

                            11. Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.
