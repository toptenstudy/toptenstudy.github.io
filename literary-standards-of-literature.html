                                            3. The development of Philippine literature in English start- tality, considering various factors at work in the first years ed at a slow pace. This was no reflection on Filipino men- of the American occupation. First, it was humanly impos- sible for the Filipino nation to recover quickly from the paralyzing effects of the repression in thought and speech which has been their lot under Spanish rule. The Filipinos could not, therefore, take immediate advantage of their newly acquired right to be heard. Second, the Filipinos first had to learn a medium alien to them in its psychology, construction, sound, and spelling. Third, even if after they had learned the English language sufficiently for ordinary communication, they discovered that literary standards for English differed radically from those in the vernacular literatures (or in Spanish which formed part of the herit- age of the more fortunate).​</a>

                        <p>Attention Grabber: Have you ever wondered what it would be like if all the ancient literatures were shredded? The Library of Congress has decided to shred some of the most famous epic literatures that have been published long ago. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I strongly believe that these literatures should be saved.</p><p></p><p>Focus: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. However, the decision to shred some of the most famous epic literatures is a grave mistake. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of the culture and history of our ancestors. Destroying them would be like erasing a part of our past.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Evidence and Examples: One of the most famous epic literatures that is at risk of being shredded is the Epic of Gilgamesh. This literature is considered one of the earliest surviving works of literature and is a representation of the Mesopo.tamiam culture. It tells the story of a king who goes on a journey to find eternal life and is a reflection of the human desire for immortality. Another literature that is at risk is the Iliad, which is an ancient Greek epic poem that tells the story of the Trojan War. This literature is a representation of the Greek culture and is a reflection of their values and beliefs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Grammar: It is important to preserve these literatures for future generations to read and learn from. Destroying them would be a great loss to our society. We should not let these literatures be shredded and forgotten. Instead, we should cherish them and pass them down to future generations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Audience: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I urge the members of the Library of Congress to reconsider their decision to shred these literatures. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of our culture and history. We should not let them be destroyed.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
