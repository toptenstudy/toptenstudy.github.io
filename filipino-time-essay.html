But most of all I am heartened by the fact that you perceive in what you call the Marcos ideology a suitable purpose for your purpose and a moving force for year commitment. I am not surprised by this action on your part, for what you call—and others call—the Marcos ideology is not the authorship of one man; the genuine authorship belongs to the Filipino people, and to you, who are conscious of being Filipino, the ideology cannot be but compelling and attractive.An ideology, as you well know may be formulated and defined by one man or a few, but it cannot be a true ideology unless it stems from the historical experience—the blood and guts—of a people conscious of their destiny. Just as you and I have been shaped by our respective life experiences, a national ideology springs from the very agonies, sacrifices, dreams and aspirations of a race, a people who have shared a common existence.That ideology is emergent among our people. I say “emergent” because we have only begun to see ourselves with our own eyes, to confront our history with determined purpose, perhaps, we may even set the date of that beginning a decade ago, when confronted with the gravest crisis our young nation has ever known, we recognized the supreme necessity of survival. Our society was on the verge of collapse, our nation on the brink of dismemberment, and our people at the very edge o<br />

                        <p>Today, environmental problems experienced in the Philippines include pollution, illegal mining, and logging, deforestation, threats to environmental activists, dynamite fishing, landslides, coastal erosion, biodiversity loss, extinction, and global warming. and climate change. Due to missing or destroyed documentation, a complete history of land use in the archipelago is difficult to find. However, existing data shows destructive land use increased significantly in the 18th century when resources from the Philippines were brought into the global market during Spanish imperialism. The Philippines is projected to be one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change. One of the largest of these concerns is the exacerbation of natural disasters, like earthquakes, typhoons, and volcanic eruptions, that the area is prone to due to its geographic location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. International cooperation can circumvent protracted legal challenges, public disagreement, and conflict. Cooperation is both desirable and necessary for a wide range of sustainability-related transboundary issues including climate change, pollution, resource depletion, and commercial fishing.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>napatunayan mo Ang kahalagaan Ng masipag mapagpunyagi at displinado sa Gawain tulad Ng pag aaral</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Aha just the right question for me since I delve a lot on political debates.</p><p></p><p>As of right now in the situation of our country, we have been on the grasp of multiple problems that has not been thoroughly solved nor given any proper attention and rarely talked about in the news. Common ones are the significant amount of mass unemployed citizens in our country due to the fact that most of our people are lacking education high enough to attain a degree or even simply graduate college, pretty much half of our population have only graduated high school and you can't blame them since life is very miserable and gruesome in our country especially if your born to a family with impoverish wealth that has children of 6 or even more than 6 due to their lack of common sense that breeding 6 children when your poor will result to your sons very malnourish and will probably die. Some who survived are basically slaves to their family since they'll be tasked to work early at the age of 8 going on jeeps to beg for money.</p><p></p><p>Back to the first problem which unemployment, most works are highly demanding the worker to have "experience" of which if your only about to start your career it's very hard to be employed, I have seen examples where such people that has graduated college and even attain a degree still find it hard to be employed. Sometimes it's even worse when your course are not in demand on the job list.</p><p></p><p>Now we shall delve in economic standings, we have been on the inflation long before the covid crisis due to questionable funding's that our government has been doing whether it's related to half-done infrastructures or other rushed projects with low quality materials that does not relay properly to the finished project price when the over-all low quality materials only estimate around 600,000 Pesos and if you include the salary let's say it'll be 1.8 million at the very least but prices are not right when they are declared more than 10 million and with no proper given information why it suddenly changed that substantially. Again that all depends on how big the project it but that is the general perspective on what's happening.</p><p></p><p>As for our Social problems, most families tends to pressure their children to pursue heavy paying careers only to be basically a credit card to their family, buying whatever things the "whole family" lust for, I say whole family because even distant cousins that you do not know will all of sudden beg you for things only for his own happiness.</p><p></p><p>Then the Cultural problems where it has been said by General. Antonio Luna that it's very hard to unite a country that is culturally diverse and are against each other's will. What he says bears the very truth we have now, since our country is divided to 3 parts it all has it's own culture so to speak. I have seen and experience with my own eyes where Filipinos from Visayas, speaks English and they know more of English than "mainland language" in Luzon which is Tagalog, they speak their province language fluently but can barely understand sometimes mainland Tagalog and they would prefer to engage in an English conversation than mainland Tagalog. Point is where not "fiercely united" and still lack cooperation with one another especially the fact that Filipinos are famed for "Crab mentality" since it's very true that we have been against each other for centuries even after we are united. Blood spilled among our own people.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paki-ayos na lang po para bumagay talaga sa essay, binigyan na kita ng general view sa mga issues ng mga filipino pero marami parin ibang issue na kulang kayo na lang po bahala mag-dagdag.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>CRAB MENTALITY (an essay)<p></p><p>a guide to fulfill an informative essay</p><p></p>Meaning of Crab Mentality<p>"Misery likes company"</p>There is a reality corresponding to the old proverb that misery loves company. Like many wise and common-sense thoughts, it purports to explain a pattern of human behavior that seems to repeat itself over and over again, giving it the hallmark of truth. My parents passed this proverb on to me, just as their parents had passed it on to them – without thinking about it. However, when taken a step further and placed in a social context, the secret of the misery-creating matrix is ​​revealed; indeed, once people internalize the artificial reasoning that misery is inevitable, they are doomed to a life of despair. They thus surround themselves with people who have reached the same conclusion, as if to reinforce their submission to the chains of consensual reality with the weight of mutual recognition.<p></p>The reason for having a crab mentalityIn reality, they are afraid of the functioning that they do not know. Fear of the transformation of their wife. Just like losing the person they love! Thus, they prefer to take the negative path rather than raising their consciousness and taking off their blinders.It is very easy to determine. Think of a situation that has already happened to you, where someone wanted to hold you back. You were part of a group and you wanted to leave, change or evolve differently from the people in your environment.<p></p>On the other hand, if this same crab is in the bucket with other crabs, the latter will not want to let it go. They will try to hold her back and prevent her from getting out of the bucket instead of supporting her. Ferociously.<p></p>Psychosocial factorsThe theory perfectly reflects the reaction of the surrounding world in a single person. For example, if you try to quit smoking, your friends shout that it's impossible. I decided to invest in stocks - parents say this is a dirty trick. Why not touch - there will be people who will confidently declare the impossibility of the project.<p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/23775275?referrer=searchResults</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 health crisis has taken a heavy toll on the daily lives of slum dwellers and those trying to survive on what's left of the informal economy in the Philippines.</p><p>Dambie Reyes Estremos is a dumpster diver living on Magnetic Hill in Los Baños, some 63 kilometers (39 miles) southeast of the capital Manila. She earns her living by selling what she finds among the rubbish at the community-based material recovery facility (MRF) in the barangay, or district, of Timugan.  </p><p></p><p>In normal times, Estremos earns roughly 1,000 pesos (€18, $19.70) per week to support herself and her four children. But since President Rodrigo Duterte declared a Luzon island-wide lockdown on March 16 to curb the coronavirus outbreak, Estremos, like most informal workers in the Philippines, has managed to scavenge next to nothing in the past month.</p><p></p><p>Dumpster divers make up an important part of the Philippines' vast informal economy, but because of the lockdown and strict restrictions on movement and social interaction, they can't sell any of the products they find or trade anything in exchange for goods. So Estremos is collecting as much as she can for the time being and hopes to cash in on all her findings when the enhanced community quarantine is lifted.</p><p></p><p>"What we need are rice, coffee and sugar to fight sleepiness and work all day long," Estremos told DW. She is also calling for facemasks, vitamins and gloves to be distributed among the region's dumpster divers to safeguard their "daily survival." The national government made wearing facemasks mandatory as of April 2.</p><p></p><p>Duterte, who spearheaded the Philippines' war on drugs and is famous for his openly vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of criminals and drug users, said he would order the police and military to "shoot dead" anyone who violates quarantine rules. A 63-year-old farmer in the southern town of Nasipit, who allegedly threatened authorities with a scythe while under the influence of alcohol, was the first reported civilian shot dead by police for not wearing a facemask.</p><p></p><p>Subscribe to Corona Compact — DW's newsletter tracking coronavirus in Asia</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being a student in times of Covid-19</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Being a student is already difficult in normal times... Most of us attempt to juggle studying, earning a livelihood, gaining early job experience (e.g. internships), and attending one or more student parties (obviously for networking). Being a student amid a worldwide epidemic is terrifying, to say the least.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that living and studying in Germany is already something many (young) people want to, and Germany definitely handled Covid-19 admirably, so every issue detailed below may be interpreted as moaning about first-world difficulties. Nonetheless, Germany's universities, or more broadly, its educational system, are not widely renowned for being leaders in digitalized learning. Some institutes are faring better than others, either because they previously placed a greater emphasis on offering digitalized learning and testing services, or because they swiftly adapted to it.</p><p>Without a doubt, no one could have predicted a worldwide catastrophe, and it is always simpler to point out what could have been done better in retrospect than it is during times of uncertainty and the urgent need to act. So, rather than throwing accusations and blame about, which is a) pointless and b) something I am not in a position to do anyhow, let's focus on what can be done to alleviate some circumstances. Moving to digitalized educational offers has many advantages, but the quick changes necessitated by Covid-19 have also resulted in certain difficulties that could have been avoided with more time and a more stable economic and social context.As a result, I'd want to look at some issues that have arisen for students in recent months and provide some examples of how to cope with them.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Filipino Time</p><p></p><p>Title: Understanding Filipino Time: Its Impact on Filipino Culture and Society</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In the Philippines, being late is often considered a cultural norm, commonly referred to as "Filipino Time." It is a cultural trait that reflects the laid-back nature of Filipinos and their tendency to prioritize personal relationships and social interactions over punctuality. However, this attitude towards time has its drawbacks and can have a negative impact on society. This essay aims to shed light on Filipino Time, its origins, and its effects on Filipino culture and society.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Filipino Time is deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. During the Spanish colonization, Filipinos were subjected to strict schedules and routines imposed by the colonial authorities. This led to a rebellion against the enforcement of time, which eventually manifested into the cultural norm of being late. Today, Filipino Time is seen as a reflection of the country's laid-back and relaxed lifestyle. However, this cultural trait has a negative impact on the country's productivity and efficiency. Being late can cause delays and inconvenience, and it can become a hindrance to the growth and development of the country.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Filipino Time can also have a negative impact on personal relationships. Being late can cause frustration and disappointment, especially in professional and social settings. It can also be interpreted as a sign of disrespect and lack of consideration for other people's time. In contrast, being punctual shows respect, responsibility, and professionalism. It can build trust and strengthen relationships.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, Filipino Time is a cultural trait deeply ingrained in Filipino society. While it reflects the country's laid-back and relaxed lifestyle, it can also have negative consequences on productivity, efficiency, and personal relationships. Therefore, it is important for Filipinos to be aware of the impact of being late and to strive towards punctuality and professionalism. By doing so, Filipinos can contribute to the growth and development of the country and build stronger personal relationships.</p><br />
