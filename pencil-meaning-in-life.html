If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</a>

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below. Do this in a short bond paper with 1 cm margins. • Any coloring materials available • Ruler • Short bond paper​</a>

Draw a logo design that represent your dream/ambition in life. 2. The evidence of elements of arts and principles of design are required in your logo. 3.You can use any object on your logo. 4. After sketching, apply the appropriate colors, space, balance and emphasis in your drawing. 5.Below your design, write a paragraph to convey the meaning of your design.           how to do this just give me an example.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Note: For example, I have a logo design (keep it simple, but not too simple) that represents my dream/ambition (being a teacher) in life. I added a poem about it to make it interesting. If it had color with it, I bet it will look livelier!! But since I'm just stating an example, it doesn't need to be detailed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explaination</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>How you do this is really up to you. Just focus on your dream/ambition in life. Maybe, something that you really look forward to everyday! The elements and principles are necessary too so please keep that in mind while you're making this. Then, add in colors and details on your logo! I'm sure you'll have fun doing that! :)☆</p><p>Lastly, explain what your logo is about, since it's a paragraph it should be as least 5 sentences. I hope it's understandable and I hope I helped you on your Performance Task! Thank you and have a great day!! Goodluck, everything will be alright with you and your grades!! Fingers crossed! ✨</p><br />

                            6. Identify the thesis statement present in the following paragraphs below. If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</h2><br />
