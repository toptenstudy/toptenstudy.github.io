1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.

2.
Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.

3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.

They used to be friends, and the memories of their life story in Shiz University started.Elphaba from the very childhood was a rogue child, being born with green skin color, as her mother had used the green elixir. She also had a sister Nessarose in a wheelchair. When the two sisters came to Shiz, the local bosses took custody over Nessarose. Despite the sociable character of Elphaba, the green color of her skin did not allow her to make friends. Gradually, she became friends with her roommate, Glinda. She desperately desired to meet the Wizard of Oz, who allegedly was able to make her look like of a usual person.Elphaba had feelings for her classmate Fiyero, even though deep down, she knew that she would never be his chosen one. He replied sympathetically, although he also liked Glinda. But their sympathy had no development – Elphaba was sent to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Dreams of help with skin color were not justified at girl – the magician used sorcerer girl's abilities to take credit for her miracles. Elphaba in despair stole an ancient magical book, and ran away being dubbed for that the Wicked Witch and it was declared her hunt down. Using magical powers, the sorcerer managed to escape.As time passed, Fiyero became a captain of the guard and announced the engagement to Glinda, which was now known as the Good Witch. A guy named Bog was also secretly in love with Glinda, though he was loved by Nessarose, who became governor after the death of her father. When Bog decided to confess Glinda his feelings, jealous Nessa has imposed on him inept spell, wishing to deprive the senses to rival. Bog’s heart began to melt, and in order to save him, Elphaba turned him into the Tin Woodman.Elphaba reconciled with the Wizard. Fiyero felt again the old feelings to Elphaba, and both of them confessed feelings to each other. Meanwhile, a tornado took Dorothy’s house with her dog Toto, and Elphaba sensed trouble: a house fell on her sister Nessarose and the latter died. It turns out that this curse was designed specifically to lure the evil sorceress out and to deal with her. Nothing was left except of mourn the dead sister and conduct Dorothy and Toto in the way to Wizard of Oz.Guards found Elphaba, but when they tried to arrest her, Fiyero gave her a chance to escape, and he surrendered. As a result, the guardians tied Fiyero to the pole and carried him to the field to where Elphaba was. To save her beloved, she turned him into a scarecrow Scarecrow, who did not feel any pain.Elphaba invented to die theatrically in the guise of the Wicked Witch. She asked her friend Glinda not to do anything to restore her good name. Because otherwise, all the people shall be against Glinda. Friends parted forever, and Elphaba gave previously stolen magical book back and promised never again to make good magic, as only misfortune happened to her because of it. They retired with her beloved Fiyero and left in a secret that Elphaba has survived.PLAY REVIEWTitle: ______________________________________________________________Main Characters: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Other Characters: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Setting: ____________________________________________________________Conflict: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Theme: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Did you like this play? ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                        <p>Summary</p><p>In Chapter 3 Carson argues every person is subjected to "elixirs of death," i.e., harmful chemicals, across the life span. She claims the effects of 20 years of synthetic pesticides cannot be avoided. First, she provides evidence for this claim: pesticide residue has been detected in water, soil, and all types of living creatures, including humans. Next, she explains how this has occurred. The development of chemicals for war resulted in the finding insects can be destroyed with such synthesized chemicals. Carson argues as the chemicals enter living things, they cause changes that are harmful, as well as irreversible. Carson argues because we are all affected by pesticide use, we all have a right to know how we are being affected.</p><p></p><p>I just found this..</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Why No?

By that, I mean seeing the world end, the swallowing of the earth by the sun, the destruction of the solar system - we will live forever to see those.</p><p>Never being able to rest by means of death, we will be forced to see what happens around us, both the bad and the good. We are powerless in the wrath of those around us, and we aren't powerful nor godly enough to stop the destruction. Money and materials breaks down and loses value overtime and so do our loved ones and such. </p><p>When everything is gone, what becomes of us now? We will still be the same, living forever, without will nor way, with darkness and nothing only accompanying us.  </p><p>Death is good, because in a way, it shows mercy to us before the end of everything.

                            6. who is jofuku?what leads sentaro into finding him? how important is he in sentaros desire to attain elixir of life? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There was a man named Sentaro  who had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on this money, spending his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, until he was about thirty-two years of age. One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him. The idea of falling ill or dying upset him. He wanted to live for five or six hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no- Shiko. This Chinese King also wanted to live forever.  During the period of his life, he sent a servant, Jakaro, to find a far away country called Horaizan. There certain hermits lived who possessed the secret of the "Elixir of Life." Sentaro was determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water of perpetual life. He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit the very high peaks.</p><p>Sentaro search on Mt. Fuji for Horaizan, but he could not find it.  He decided to go at once to the shrine of Jofuku, who was worshiped as the patron god of the hermits. There he prayed for seven days. After seven days, Jafuku himself appeared to Sentaro.  He told him that he had lived an idle life and would never be able to become a hermit because that life would be too hard for him.  However he would send him to the country of Perpetual Life, where people never die.  He then gave him a paper crane to sit on, and it flew him to his island. Sentaro became a citizen of this island. However, the people who lived there were tired of living long lives and dreamed of dying so that they could reach Paradise. They even took poison to try to die!!  None of this worked.  Sentaro decided he liked this place, and set up a business and stayed there for 300 years.  Suddenly he longed for home.  He prayed to Jofuku, and suddenly the paper crane jumped out of his pocket.  He jumped on the crane’s back, and it flew him back in the direction of Japan.  As soon as he left, he felt regret at leaving island, but there was nothing he could do.  Then a storm developed and the paper crane got wet.  Afraid he was going to drown, he prayed to Jofuku to save him.  He awoke in front of the shrine only to find that it was all a dream. </p><p>Suddenly an angel appeared to him and told him that he was allowed to see what it would be like in the land of Perpetual Life.  He found that he didn’t want that, but he also didn’t want to die because as he fell into the water, he cried out for help.  He told him to go home, live a good and industrious life, and live by the precepts of this book the angel gave him.  Sentaro did that and he and his house prospered from that time forward.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.

Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.

3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.

They used to be friends, and the memories of their life story in Shiz University started.Elphaba from the very childhood was a rogue child, being born with green skin color, as her mother had used the green elixir. She also had a sister Nessarose in a wheelchair. When the two sisters came to Shiz, the local bosses took custody over Nessarose. Despite the sociable character of Elphaba, the green color of her skin did not allow her to make friends. Gradually, she became friends with her roommate, Glinda. She desperately desired to meet the Wizard of Oz, who allegedly was able to make her look like of a usual person.Elphaba had feelings for her classmate Fiyero, even though deep down, she knew that she would never be his chosen one. He replied sympathetically, although he also liked Glinda. But their sympathy had no development – Elphaba was sent to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Dreams of help with skin color were not justified at girl – the magician used sorcerer girl's abilities to take credit for her miracles. Elphaba in despair stole an ancient magical book, and ran away being dubbed for that the Wicked Witch and it was declared her hunt down. Using magical powers, the sorcerer managed to escape.As time passed, Fiyero became a captain of the guard and announced the engagement to Glinda, which was now known as the Good Witch. A guy named Bog was also secretly in love with Glinda, though he was loved by Nessarose, who became governor after the death of her father. When Bog decided to confess Glinda his feelings, jealous Nessa has imposed on him inept spell, wishing to deprive the senses to rival. Bog’s heart began to melt, and in order to save him, Elphaba turned him into the Tin Woodman.Elphaba reconciled with the Wizard. Fiyero felt again the old feelings to Elphaba, and both of them confessed feelings to each other. Meanwhile, a tornado took Dorothy’s house with her dog Toto, and Elphaba sensed trouble: a house fell on her sister Nessarose and the latter died. It turns out that this curse was designed specifically to lure the evil sorceress out and to deal with her. Nothing was left except of mourn the dead sister and conduct Dorothy and Toto in the way to Wizard of Oz.Guards found Elphaba, but when they tried to arrest her, Fiyero gave her a chance to escape, and he surrendered. As a result, the guardians tied Fiyero to the pole and carried him to the field to where Elphaba was. To save her beloved, she turned him into a scarecrow Scarecrow, who did not feel any pain.Elphaba invented to die theatrically in the guise of the Wicked Witch. She asked her friend Glinda not to do anything to restore her good name. Because otherwise, all the people shall be against Glinda. Friends parted forever, and Elphaba gave previously stolen magical book back and promised never again to make good magic, as only misfortune happened to her because of it. They retired with her beloved Fiyero and left in a secret that Elphaba has survived.PLAY REVIEWTitle: ______________________________________________________________Main Characters: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Other Characters: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Setting: ____________________________________________________________Conflict: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Theme: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Did you like this play? ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
