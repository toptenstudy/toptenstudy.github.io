This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</a>

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching Set A, Directions.

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

                                            PRE-TESTDirections: Read the paragraph below. Choose the letter of the correct answer. Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.

It is a very informative <strong>channel</strong> where there are assigned instructors for each lesson of each subject. Especially in this situation, where there are no face to face classes. Every student has different process of learning. Every student have their own paces. Having this <strong>channel</strong>, it makes the learning more easier in this situation. Even though there are no face to face classes, the students are able to just search in this social media platform about the topic that is harder to understand and that the student will be able to find a lecture about the topic online. This <strong>channel </strong>makes it possible for the students who prefer listening to lectures, to understand the lesson even though, there are no physical classes. As I had mentioned, the students have there own preferences when it comes to the method of learning. Some students prefer to read, some, prefers to listen. This project created by DepEd is very helpful to the students as well as the fact that an actual instructor is teaching the lesson.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Because of the situation, the Department of Education has been doing what they can for the students to adjust and attain the same level of learning comparing the physical classes and the online classes. </p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/14393531</p><br />

This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</h2><br />

                            14. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching Set A, Directions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Stress is defined as a physical, physiological, or emotional condition that creates stresses and can lead to physical sickness in medicine. Stress is a psychological term that refers to both heightened mental and physical states as well as the cause of such conditions. Stress, in general, is your body's reaction to anything that you feel as overwhelming, whether positive or negative. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life; without it, you would be unable to function. It is critical to determine your optimal level of stress – the equilibrium at which you are most driven – because too much or too little will limit your productivity. Excessive stress can negatively impact your relationships at home, school, and even at work.</p><p>It also deprives your health and energy resources, which may be put to better use. Aside from that, your thoughts and emotions toward yourself can be badly influenced. Also, medical research suggests that stress is responsible for up to 90% of ailments, problems, and diseases. "Eighty-three percent of deaths for adults between the ages of twenty-one and sixty-five are related to lifestyle," according to the United States Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. Stress can be harmful to one's health, so it's critical to understand its causes and manage it at an optimal level. What is unpleasant for one person may not be stressful for another.</p><p></p><br />

                            26. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Thesis statement: I will show you the two best reasons why education is important in our society hi po pahelp po please needed napo​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

                            27. PRE-TESTDirections: Read the paragraph below. Choose the letter of the correct answer. Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.
