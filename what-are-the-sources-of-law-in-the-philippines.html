                                            Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

I"I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines--Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boyand during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what hecould get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. Duringthose Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice.Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me toinstruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary educationread and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primaryat San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-messboy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house ofan aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from theWalled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started atseven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, thisen, answer the questions that follow.

I came to Manila and spoke to myDominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. Iwanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of thehelpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law." own Source: http://www quezon ph/familyinfo/autoblography of manuell quezon-from-a-privilege-speech/ 1.

                                            Directions: Arrange the following tips that could help you avoid copyright infringement in order using
the numbers 1-4.
_____Ask yourself whether what you are making is something that came from you or
something made from somebody else's creativity.
_____Even if material does not say that it is copyrighted, it is not a valid defense against
copyright, Be responsible enough to know If something has a copyright.
_____There are some limitations to copyright laws. For instance, in the Philippines, copyrights 
only last a lifetime (of the author) plus 50 years. There are also provisions for "fair use" which mean
that an intellectual property may be used without a consent as long as it is used in commentaries,
criticisms, search engines, parodies, news reports, research, library archiving, teaching and education.
______Copyright literary works, photographs, paintings, drawings, films, music (and lyrics)
choreography and sculptures, but it generally does NOT protect underlying ideas and facts. This
means, you can express something using your own words, but should give credit to the source.

                                            MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</a>

                            15. Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-messboy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house ofan aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.

                            21. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law." own Source: http://www quezon ph/familyinfo/autoblography of manuell quezon-from-a-privilege-speech/ 1.

only last a lifetime (of the author) plus 50 years. There are also provisions for "fair use" which mean
that an intellectual property may be used without a consent as long as it is used in commentaries,
criticisms, search engines, parodies, news reports, research, library archiving, teaching and education.

He also has the power of reward, which is the ability to give rewards such as benefits or merits to those who have put in extra effort and been dedicated to their work. His use of these powers can have positive consequences, such as higher morale, loyalty and motivation among his employees.

                            29. MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>1. Three Generations of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights have been categorized into three generations based on the time period and the focus of the rights.</p><p></p><p>First Generation: Civil and Political Rights</p><p>The first generation of human rights includes civil and political rights, which were first recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>Second Generation: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</p><p>The second generation of human rights emerged in the mid-20th century and focused on economic, social, and cultural rights. These rights include the right to education, work, social security, healthcare, and a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and their family.</p><p></p><p>Third Generation: Collective Rights</p><p>The third generation of human rights arose in the latter half of the 20th century and focuses on collective rights. These include the right to peace, a clean and healthy environment, and the right to self-determination of peoples and their cultures.</p><p></p><p>2. Sources of Human Rights Law in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution and laws are the primary sources of human rights law in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution specifically enumerates the civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights of all Filipino citizens. The Bill of Rights, in particular, outlines the fundamental rights of individuals and imposes limitations on the power of the state to ensure the protection of these rights.</p><p></p><p>International law is also a source of human rights law in the Philippines. The Philippines has ratified several international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. These treaties have become part of Philippine law and are recognized as sources of human rights law.</p><p></p><p>3. Personal Opinion on Human Rights Issues in our Country</p><p></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, I can provide a general statement on human rights issues in the Philippines. Despite the existence of laws and treaties protecting human rights, violations of these rights still occur in the Philippines. Human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture continue to be reported. There is a need for the government to uphold its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and for individuals to be aware of their rights and actively advocate for them.</p><br />
