                                            Please paki answer kailanganko na po itoDirections: Read and understand each paragraph. Put the correct number sequence to show the explanation of the water cycle.Paragraph No. The earth has a limited amount of water. We get fresh water through the water cycle. Paragraph No After all these processes, the cycle starts again. Paragraph No. So, over and over again, the water moves from the oceans and the rivers to the clouds. Then it falls into the land as rain and moves back to ocean and rivers.Paragraph No.The water cycle has four parts. The first part is evaporation. Evaporation is when the sun heats up the water from the ocean and rivers and turns into water vapor or steam, this means it changes from liquid into gas. This gas goes into the air.Paragraph No.Then, when so much water has condensed, the clouds become very heavy, and the air cannot hold it anymore, thus precipitation happens. The water falls back to the earth in the form of rain or snow.Paragraph No. The final part of the cycle is collection. Water from precipitation when it ends up on the land, it will either soak into the earth and become part of the ground water that plants and animals use to drink or it may run over the soil and collect in the oceans, rivers and lakes.Paragraph No. The next part of the water cycle is condensation. When water vapor gets cold, it turns into small drops of water. These becomes clouds.​</a>

Igneous rock comes from cooling and solidification of 2 3 are formed from sediments coming from weathering and erosion of older rocks. Some examples are sandstone, limestone, shale and conglomerate. Metamorphic rocks change over time applying intense heat and 4 From extreme heat and pressure, rock is changing from original rock to completely new rock. This is called 5 The two types of metamorphism are contact metamorphism and regional metamorphism. Contact metamorphism involves 6 while regional metamorphism involves 7 8 is group of changes of rock. From sedimentary rock it can change to metamorphic rock; from igneous rock to metamorphic rock; or from metamorphic to sedimentary, or vice versa. From igneous rock turns sedimentary rock. This process is called 9 where rocks can be broken down into pieces through contact of the earth's atmosphere. A metamorphic rock when added with melting magma, it solidifies. The process called 10 thus make up an igneous rock. The cycle repeats over and over again. a &gt;​</a>

Put the correct number sequence to show the explanation of the water cycle.Paragraph No. The earth has a limited amount of water. We get fresh water through the water cycle. Paragraph No After all these processes, the cycle starts again. Paragraph No. So, over and over again, the water moves from the oceans and the rivers to the clouds. Then it falls into the land as rain and moves back to ocean and rivers.Paragraph No.The water cycle has four parts. The first part is evaporation. Evaporation is when the sun heats up the water from the ocean and rivers and turns into water vapor or steam, this means it changes from liquid into gas. This gas goes into the air.Paragraph No.Then, when so much water has condensed, the clouds become very heavy, and the air cannot hold it anymore, thus precipitation happens. The water falls back to the earth in the form of rain or snow.Paragraph No. The final part of the cycle is collection. Water from precipitation when it ends up on the land, it will either soak into the earth and become part of the ground water that plants and animals use to drink or it may run over the soil and collect in the oceans, rivers and lakes.Paragraph No. The next part of the water cycle is condensation. When water vapor gets cold, it turns into small drops of water. These becomes clouds.​</h2><br />

Contact metamorphism involves 6 while regional metamorphism involves 7 8 is group of changes of rock. From sedimentary rock it can change to metamorphic rock; from igneous rock to metamorphic rock; or from metamorphic to sedimentary, or vice versa. From igneous rock turns sedimentary rock. This process is called 9 where rocks can be broken down into pieces through contact of the earth's atmosphere. A metamorphic rock when added with melting magma, it solidifies.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All living things need nutrients.
</p><p>the energy the body needs comes from the food it
</p><p>eats. The parts of the body that help break down the food it eats and turn it into energy
</p><p>for the body is called the digestive system. The digestive system is responsible for digesting food to nourish all of the cells

Do all substance sublimates? 4. What is the process involved when solid turns into gas? 5. In places with very cold weather, why might frost be more likely to form? 6. What is the process involved when gas turns into solid? PLSSSS HELP ME​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.mothballs are typically used to repel moths and other insects from drawers or closets, and their strong odor can be noticed in the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>2.Mothballs disappear over time due to a process called sublimation, where a solid material transitions directly into a gas without going through the liquid phase. This causes the solid mothballs to gradually shrink and disappear, as they release their gaseous components into the air.</p><p></p><p>3.No, not all substances sublimate. Only certain substances, such as mothballs and dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), have the ability to sublimate.</p><p></p><p>4.The process involved when a solid turns into gas is called sublimation. This occurs when the solid substance absorbs enough energy (usually in the form of heat) to break the intermolecular bonds holding the molecules together. The molecules then transition directly into the gas phase without going through the liquid phase.</p><p></p><p>5.In places with very cold weather, frost may be more likely to form because the air contains less moisture, and therefore, less water vapor. When the temperature drops below freezing, any moisture in the air can condense onto surfaces and freeze, creating frost.</p><p></p><p>6.The process involved when a gas turns into a solid is called deposition. This occurs when a gas loses energy (usually in the form of heat) and the molecules come together to form a solid substance, skipping the liquid phase. Examples of deposition include the formation of frost on a cold surface or the formation of snowflakes in the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>not sure about this cause I'm not the one who did the experiment(?) </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps ;)</p><p></p><br />
