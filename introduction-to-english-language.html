2. What part of a critique is being described in this paragraph? The preference of the author of the English translation of ‘alas tres o ikatlo ng umaga’ which is three o'clock in the morning may suggest that America (which is the key proponent of the English language) played part in this poem. May be not the country as a whole but the people who were based there during the time of the author

                                            What I Can Do Your task is to write a critical review of a myth or story found in your gion or hometown. It may be written in English or in other languages. Your review must be one to two pages long, double-spaced, and with a proper title. Writing Short Paper A short paper is literally "short. It consists of one or two pages of written critique that will succinctly discuss your idea, realization, or concept regarding a literary selection. The point here is to introduce your idea or discovery about a literary selection Tips in Writing Short Paper 1. Choose a literary selection that you want to analyse. 2. Always begin with an outline. 3. Start with a joke, an anecdote, or a quotation from the literary text as your introduction.(The idea is to hook your readers so that they will be more willing to listen to your idea). 4. The body of your essay must try to discuss the relation of your idea with the literary text. The conclusion is just like any conclusion when you are writing an essay- summarize what you have said or discussed in the body in two to three sentences.​</a>

However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</a>

                            6. patulong Po please diko nakaya bukas na defense, kahit paliwanag lang Po kung pano to INTRODUCTIONThe advent of digital technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, particularly in writing. However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>New experiences are always good you learn life lessons and learn from your mistakes. Your first day at school is always different depending on where you go. When I was first starting school it was different from usual because I had never been to school and had no idea what to expect.
</p><p>
</p><p>“It’s too early!” I moan as my Mum removed the covers from my head allowing light to flood into my eyes. My eyes struggle to adjust to the sudden change of light. The blurred colours that are my room mix to make strange shades of colours without names. I eventually found a blur of colours resembling my mum. “Why do I have to get up this early?”
</p><p>
</p><p>“Because it’s time for school,” she replied, lifting me out of my bed onto the cold tiled floor of my room. “Go get ready. Your bag is down at the car.”
</p><p>
</p><p>After my morning routine of brushing my teeth and getting dressed, I went down to the car and found my bag. I put my bag on my back moaning as if it weighed hundreds of kilograms. As I went into the car, the heat of being out in the sun hit me like a brick. The only sound to be heard in the car was the gentle rattling of the engine.
</p><p>
</p><p>After ten to fifteen minutes of driving the rattling of the engine came to a halt as we stopped outside the school. I was unsure about this place the fences had decorations the looked like the ends of the spears while the gates had large padlocks on them. When I reached the gate there was a blast of cold air as the air-conditioning flooded outside into the tropical heat. We walked into a room with about twenty kids with the same blank confused expression that I had.  </p><p>
</p><p>My mum then asked “Do you like your new school”
</p><p>
</p><p>“It looks great,” I reply, unsure about this new place.
</p><p>
</p><p>“I’ll pick you up when you finish. Just wait outside”
</p><p>
</p><p>I sat down with the other children and listened to our teacher as she spoke about how fun school was going to be. I looked on the wall and saw colourful paintings from previous classes. The teacher soon had us painting pictures just as bright to replace the ones being taken down. She read the class a story out of a ridiculously large book and let us play for a while with the blocks and other toys. Finally the teacher took us outside to wait for our parents.  </p><p>
</p><p>At first, I was unsure about pre-school, but i soon came to get ready as fast as I could to get more time to play with my friends. I didn’t know that later on these times and wish I could go back to them. They were my first days of school and some of the best of my life.</p><br />
