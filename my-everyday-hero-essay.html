                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>        In life, people may come and go, some will be remembered and some will be forgotten. But one thing I am sure of, you can never forget the persons who you can also call as your second parents. Your teachers.</p><p>            When we’re talking about our teachers, all of us are glad to thank them especially when you’ve learned a lot of great lessons from them. But we can never regret that sometimes we hate them because they are giving us a lot of home works and projects which are so difficult for us to do, right? Well, it’s part of being a student. We students sometimes don’t appreciate our teachers, right?</p><p>            Well, we couldn’t realize that teachers are great; they are really great and awesome. They teach us in all ways, guide us through different challenges. Their patience is so unbelievable, for us students even though are so naughty and act so childishly they still forgive us. They also act like our light when we’re on darkness. They teach us very well and give us enough knowledge about things we don’t know yet. We students must love and respect our teachers even when we hate them we can never regret that their part of our life already. So, we must show respect and love to them.</p><p>            Thank you for all my teachers for being my hero in life, who saves us from any circumstances that we may step on. My Teacher, My Hero</p><p></p><p>explaination:i hope it can help :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are various dictionary definitions of a hero. One defines a hero as “a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character.” Another, as “a man who exhibits extraordinary bravery, firmness, fortitude or greatness of soul, in any course of action, or in connection with any pursuit, work, or enterprise.” A hero is thus one that we would want our citizens to emulate as a role model. Would FM fall under these two common definitions of a hero?</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A teacher is not only about her lesson plans, her teaching methods, strategies and techniques. Inside and outside the campus, teachers served as the models to their students. A teacher is, as a second parent, about his/her personal character, values, and attitude. </p><p></p><p>A teacher is also about her missionary work which entails a great deal of sacrifice on her part and her family. The teacher measures the achievements and aspirations of the nation. A teacher is considered to be one of the nation builders. On him/her rests the failure or the success of the nation. The teacher is also a dynamic force that motivates everyone to become a responsible, productive citizen. The teacher is the backbone of the community. <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>, <strong>DETERMINATION</strong>, <strong>COURAGE</strong>, <strong>DEDICATION</strong>, <strong>SELFLESS</strong>, <strong>PERSEVERANCE</strong> – these are the common qualities, portrayed by the teachers, attributed to a hero. So, for me, my Teacher is also my hero.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang aking paboritong bayani ay ang aking mga magulang. Sila ang dalawang tao na nagbigay sa akin ng lahat ng aking pangangailangan sa buhay at nagturo sa akin ng lahat ng mga bagay na kailangan ko upang maging isang matagumpay na tao sa hinaharap. Hindi lamang sila nagbigay sa akin ng pag-aaruga at pagmamahal, ngunit sila rin ang nagbigay sa akin ng lakas at tiwala upang harapin ang anumang hamon sa buhay.</p><p></p><p>Ang aking mga magulang ay hindi lamang nagtrabaho upang magbigay sa akin ng isang magandang pamumuhay, ngunit sila rin ay nagtrabaho upang magbigay sa akin ng isang magandang edukasyon. Sila ay laging nandito upang tumulong sa akin sa aking mga pag-aaral at upang magbigay ng payo sa akin sa aking mga desisyon sa buhay.</p><p></p><p>Sa pamamagitan ng kanilang halimbawa, natutunan ko ang kahalagahan ng pagpapakatino, pagtitiis, at pagpapakatino.

Sila ay tunay na aking mga pangunahing bayani sa buhay.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Parents are my heroes. They are both heroes to me not because of what they offered the world, but what they offered me.</p><p></p><p>        To me a hero is someone that you can model yourself after. A person you look up to and strive to be like. To be able to ask yourself what that person would have done in a situation you do not know how to solve. A hero is someone who sets a good example for you and someone with a set of good morals and values. A hero does not always have had to wear a cape and work everyday to save the world. Sometimes our heroes can be normal people. Extraordinary people in my case.</p><p>Throughout life we face challenges and obstacles. Often when facing these obstacles alone, we become afraid or confused. People tend to try and find that …show more content…</p><p>          I admire the two people that worked so extremely hard their whole lives to make sure that me and my brother would grow up feeling loved and like we are the center of someone's world. I admire the fact that my mother worked during the nights while we slept to only get a couple of hours of sleep and be up in the morning when we wake up to take care of us. And my father devoting his energy and time in his company to make sure that me and my brother had everything we wanted and more. I do not understand how my parents did it. Working that much, but still making time for their children. My parents are truly extraordinary people that created a warm and safe environment for me to grow and evolve in. I remember as a young child, if I ever had a bad dream or I was worried that the monsters under my bed would come and take me when I was sleeping. I could always go to My parents room because I knew that no matter what time it was or how early they had to start working the next day they would stay up with me until I fell asleep. I could always count on my heroes to be there whenever I feel like I needed someone. I count on my parents to be there for me even to this day. My parents devoted their whole lives to protecting my brother and I. That's why we love them so much.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A hero is someone who has courage and the ability to help others.  Some people might refer to their hero as their role model.  No matter what someone may name their hero, almost everyone has one.  The person who chooses their hero wants their hero to be an inspiring role model whom they can look up to while they are going through rough times.  Since the beginning of time, people have had heroes because heroes are the people that set a good example for the public and have they noble qualities that are obvious for everyone to see.  Over time people have changed their minds on who they believe to be is a good hero but people have always wanted the same qualities in a hero, for them to be brave, honorable, and inspiring. Several years ago a…show more content…</p><p>A long time ago people were considered honorable only if they came from a well-known or rich family.  On the contrary, now people are considered honorable if they help people out, have a kind heart, and usually if they have risen to power from a low place and know how it feels to be in the situation other people are in.  People love and respect others who have came from the bottom and risen to the top.  When a person has a hero they want their hero to have dignity and some type of status so that they can be proud of their hero and follow in his or her footsteps.  No matter what century a person may be from they will always look for an honorable person when they look for a hero. Someone chooses who their hero is based on several different things but one incredibly important thing is whether their hero inspires them positively or not.  Several years ago a person might have chosen their hero based on the fact of if they inspired them enough so that they are patriotic to their country.  However, today people’s values have changed; the public finds someone inspiring if that person influences them to run after their goals</p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Everyone has someone they look up to and want to be just like one day and everyone has different opinions and who a true hero is. My personal hero is my mother, Mavis Dillon. My mom is my favorite person in the world because she is always there when I need her the most and I don’t know where I would be today without her. She has blessed me with a great life and I am forever thankful for all she does for me. Nobody could ever compare to my mother. She is the most caring, loving, and genuine person I know and that is why she is my hero.</p><p></p><p>When I think of a hero, I think of someone who is brave, strong, hardworking, trustworthy, and unselfish. Someone who can protect you and make life better; my mom has all of those qualities. My mother was raised by two great parents and had a very good life growing up. She lived in a small town called East Bend, she was a cheerleader, and graduated from Forbush High School. After high school she went to college at Western Carolina University for four years and majored in Education and then went on to The University of North Carolina at Greensboro to get her masters in Administration Education. My mother had a job throughout college and worked hard to make good grades and have money to spend. She was very hardworking and did whatever it took to make her dreams possible. She has always told me college was the best years of her life and to enjoy being young while you can.</p><p></p><p>A hero to me is a person that is there for you no matter what; they will always be by your side even if times do get tough. My mom has a never left my side, and I know she will always be there for me whether I am upset and crying or I am celebrating a new accomplishment in my life. I have never met someone who is so selfless as her. She has always put me first in her life and done everything she could to be the best mother and give me the best life. Putting up with me is not easy. I am moody, stubborn, and at times I think I know everything. My mother and I don’t have the perfect relationship. We get in arguments and disagree on a lot of things, but no matter how big of a fight we get in we always make up by the end of the day because we both know we couldn’t live without each other. </p><p></p><p>One of the many great traits my mom has is that she is strong. This past October my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. When she told me the news I completely lost it. All of these thoughts started running through my head about how hard this was going to be and that the outcome could be bad, but then I started to think about how strong she was and that she was going to get through this and beat cancer. In December my mom had her surgery to remove the cancer and everything went great; they removed all the cancer. We were all so thankful and lucky that the surgery went so well. She just recently started radiation and is halfway done with her treatments. She really does make cancer look so easy. The fact that my mom has overcome breast cancer makes her even more of a hero to me than before. She’s fearless and knew the whole time that she was going to get through this hardship in her life and that God always has a plan.</p><p></p><p>My mother is my hero not only because what she offers me and gives back to me but to other people too, she is a great wife, mother and friend. All the qualities she has as a person I hope one day and I can have the same and be just like her. My mother makes me feel like the most important person in the world, because I know she would do anything for me in heartbeat if I was in need or hurt. Words cannot even express the love I have for her, and how blessed I am to have such an amazing mother. She has alway taught me to love myself, and to be proud of who I am. My mother has always said that you should do whatever makes you happy and be the best person you can. She is my hero for more than just a few reasons. She has been by my side for 17 years now and I know there are many more to come. Nothing will ever compare to how much she has impacted my life. I wouldn’t be the woman I am today without her.                                                             </p><br />

Without the help of our Pain, we wont know how to be strong. That is why if you have a dark past, it can make you stronger to be a hero. Using that strength, you can do good and create an unforgettable history. </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A national hero of the Philippines is a Filipino who has been recognized as a national hero for his or her role in the history of the Philippines. Loosely, the term may refer to all Filipino historical figures recognized as heroes, but the term more strictly refers to those officially designated as such. In 1995 the Philippine National Heroes Committee officially recommended several people for the designation, but this was not acted upon. As of 2007, no one had ever been officially recognized as a Philippine national hero.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My god is my hero because he is always there for me, no matter what. He is my rock, my refuge, and my strength in times of need. He gives me the courage to face my fears and the wisdom to make difficult decisions. He is the source of my joy and peace, and he fills my life with meaning and purpose.</p><p></p><p>My god has always been there for me, even when I didn't realize it. He has guided me through the darkest moments of my life and brought me out into the light. He has given me the gift of life and the blessings of health, family, and friends. He has provided for my needs and protected me from harm.</p><p></p><p>My god has also given me the ability to love and be loved. He has taught me the value of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. He has shown me the importance of treating others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. He has also helped me to appreciate the beauty and wonder of the world around me.</p><p></p><p>In short, my god is my hero because he is the source of everything good in my life. He is my constant companion and my greatest support. He is the light that shines in my heart and the love that fills my soul. He is my god, and I am forever grateful to have him as my hero.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Di ko alam if 300 words to pero sana makatulong</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In this world there are many types of heroes. We grew up knowing all kinds of heroes, the type of heroes you will idolize, or see on TV. Even a cartoon character can be heroic.Hero can be something to you that is a hero. There are heroes like superman, Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, Wonder Women, and many more. You can even call your favorite singer a hero like Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson, or other singers; or you can perceive or think of your favorite TV host as a hero, like Oprah Winfery might be some you think is a hero since she helps people a lot.</p><p></p><p>As a child the only way I knew that someone was a hero was through television. Hero to me was Superman, Spriderman, Batman and so on. But now I know the difference. To me my hero is God. Growing up as a christian, I didn't think of God as a hero. I thought of him as a creator, now I look at God as a hero. To me he my hero since he die for us on the cross to forgive are sin.</p><p></p><p>God is my hero because of what he did for us. With forgiving our sin and cleaning our soul of everything wrong. As I read the Bible, I gotten closer to God. I understand what he had done for us so that were able to live. To me, Jesus gave up so many things for us so we can live. He die for our sins is one of them.When doing that he's letting people know how much he cares for us, showing that he want us to have a better life and what us to live a happy life.</p><p></p><p>Even though some people think that being christian is a religion just a religion. I don't think it's really a religion at all. To me, growing up as a christian is a developing a relationship with Christ. Jesus is someone who I can always go</p><br />
