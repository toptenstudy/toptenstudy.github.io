My Favorite Place
Usually when you ask people what thier favoryt place is, they will talk about a distant place - maybe a bichora
buetiful mounten. But my favoryt place is not far away at all. My favoryt place is a forest behind my hous.
Althugh the forest behind my haus is not very big, when I was litle I thout it was huge. There are so many intersting
places to play and hide. I can sit on the big rocks and have a picnic, I can claymb the tall trees. ori can look for lizards and
other litle animals
. Even tho I have played their many times. I can still spend all afterun running, playing ang hiking in the
forest behing my haus.
The forrest behind my haus is a magical place. If I am in a bad mood. I will go there to be alone and think. When
was a litle, I like to imaggine that there were magical people who lived in the forest. When I grow up and have chidren,
hope that they can leave near such a spaycial place too.</a>

                         1-2: Lord of The Rings<p>While the fight at Helm's Deep accounts for a large portion of<strong> The Two Towers' most memorable scenes</strong>, there is one sequence with Sam in particular that continues to amaze viewers and acquire significance with time. In the heartbreaking scene, Sam explains to Frodo the significance of courageous and selfless characters in literature.</p><p></p><p>It's one of the trilogy's most uplifting scenes, and viewers can always think back on it when things are tough. During his stirring address, Sam makes the observation that, sometimes, people are too young to truly comprehend the significance of<strong> tremendous acts of courage </strong>like this one. Thus, as viewers get older and realize how accurate Sam is, the scene simply gains in impact.</p><p></p>3-4: Here's the script <p><strong>(note: not the actual script)  </strong>  </p><p></p><p><strong>Frodo </strong>said, "Sam, I can't do this."</p><p></p><p><strong>Sam</strong>: I am aware of that.

After everything that had happened, how could things possibly return to normal? However, this shadow is really temporary. Eventually, the night will end. At some point, the sun will rise on a whole new day. And the brighter the sun, the more clearly you'll see it. Those were the tales you would never forget. That was significant even if you didn't realize it at the time. Still, I believe I do comprehend, Mr. Frodo. Now I understand. The characters in those tales had several opportunities to change their minds, but they never did. They continued onward. Since they had something in their hands.</p><p></p><p><strong>Frodo</strong>: What exactly are we clinging to, Sam?</p><p></p><p>It is good in the world, Mr. Frodo, Sam says. and it's a battle worth having.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It was a gloomy day the sun was hiding. That was the first sentence on the novel that I am reading that make me hook up. I love those chills and mystery that thriller novels gives me. Not those cheesy "your the apple of my eyes, You take my breath away" kind of lines. Thriller is much more interesting because it is amazing how the authors writings connects with my imagination, letting me feel the sensation and all the emotions of the character as if I am also there. It is also awesome to read those books when the weather is like raining cats and dogs. Lying on your bed with a coffee beside. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Informal diction is also called colloquial language. It is the language of everyday speech.
