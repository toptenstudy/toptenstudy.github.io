With its four outer shells, carbon easily links with otheratoms in the atmosphere. Thus, numerous carbon compounds are formed. While this mayIndicate that carbon is helpful to man, it can also be destructive. Carbon has its good functions,it should be used well to produce desired results. As humans and animals breathe out carbondioxide during respiration, the air retains a little amount of carbon. This is where the problemlies. Due to the wide use of carbon-based fuels by automobiles, the combustion of these fuelsgives off carbon dioxide. Carbon quickly combines with oxygen and this is when we have tofind quick solutions.With so many cars, buses, and jeeps running, on these fuels, carbon dioxide level in theatmosphere is high, very high indeed. With the high amount of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, the terms "greenhouse effect" and "global warming" became household words. Itwas found out that the alarming accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has beentrapping heat from escaping into the outer space. This has caused man to respond alarminglyto the situation.There are new efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions. If not, there will be disastrouschanges. Global warming will bring about climate change in all parts of the world. As we nowexperience, wet seasons, become wetter, there are more fiooding, and dry seasons have becomehotter and drier-there are droughts. Man has awakened to the reality of carbon, while a friendto the environment could also be an enemy if abused and misused.Vocabulary: Match column A with column BColumn AColumn B1. carbon2. blessing3. bane4. accumulationA. causing great damageB. the product and discharge ofsomething especially gas or radiationC.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The general objectives of privatization of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) are to reduce the size of government, increase efficiency, and generate revenue for the government. Privatization can also be used as a way to introduce competition into industries that were previously monopolized by the government.</p><p></p><p>2. Some limits of privatization include the potential for increased costs for goods and services, reduced access to essential goods and services for low-income individuals, and the potential for private companies to prioritize profit over social welfare. There may also be concerns about the potential for corruption and lack of accountability in the privatization process.</p><p></p><p>3. Privatization is not necessarily the answer to government inefficiencies. It may be one option among many for addressing inefficiencies, but it is important to carefully consider the potential costs and benefits of privatization before making a decision.</p><p></p><p>4. It is difficult to give a blanket approval or disapproval of the privatization of GOCCs. The decision to privatize a particular GOCC should be based on a careful analysis of the specific circumstances and potential impacts on society. In some cases, privatization may be a beneficial choice, while in other cases it may not be the best option.</p><p></p><p>Political parties differ from other groups, such as interest groups, civil society organizations, and social movements, in several ways. Political parties are typically organized around a specific ideology or set of principles and seek to influence government policy through the election of their members to public office. Interest groups are organizations that seek to influence policy on specific issues, but do not typically seek to elect their members to public office. Civil society organizations are non-governmental organizations that work to promote the interests of a particular community or cause. Social movements are large, informal groups that seek to bring about social or political change through collective action.</p><p>1. The general objectives of privatization of government owned and controlled corporations include reducing the size and financial burden of the government, increasing efficiency and profitability of the corporations, and potentially generating revenue for the government through the sale of state assets.</p><p></p><p>2. The limits of privatization include the potential loss of control and accountability over the services or resources being provided, the potential for increased costs for the users of the services or resources, and the potential for negative social and economic impacts on certain groups.</p><p></p><p>3. It is not necessarily the case that privatization is the answer to government inefficiencies. While privatization can potentially lead to increased efficiency in some cases, it may also introduce new challenges and problems. It is important to carefully consider the potential costs and benefits of privatization in each specific context.</p><p></p><p>4. Whether or not to approve of the privatization of corporations depends on the specific circumstances and the potential costs and benefits. It is important to carefully evaluate the potential impacts on the government, the corporations and the general public before deciding whether or not to pursue privatization[tex].[/tex]</p><p></p><br />

                            17. Read the report and answer the questions that follow.n opinionbutereCarbon, Blessing or Bane?Carbon is truly wonderful. With its four outer shells, carbon easily links with otheratoms in the atmosphere. Thus, numerous carbon compounds are formed. While this mayIndicate that carbon is helpful to man, it can also be destructive. Carbon has its good functions,it should be used well to produce desired results. As humans and animals breathe out carbondioxide during respiration, the air retains a little amount of carbon. This is where the problemlies. Due to the wide use of carbon-based fuels by automobiles, the combustion of these fuelsgives off carbon dioxide. Carbon quickly combines with oxygen and this is when we have tofind quick solutions.With so many cars, buses, and jeeps running, on these fuels, carbon dioxide level in theatmosphere is high, very high indeed. With the high amount of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, the terms "greenhouse effect" and "global warming" became household words. Itwas found out that the alarming accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has beentrapping heat from escaping into the outer space. This has caused man to respond alarminglyto the situation.There are new efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions. If not, there will be disastrouschanges. Global warming will bring about climate change in all parts of the world. As we nowexperience, wet seasons, become wetter, there are more fiooding, and dry seasons have becomehotter and drier-there are droughts.
