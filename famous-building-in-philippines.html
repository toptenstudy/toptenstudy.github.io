Famous- known about by many people ROSA FARM Rosa Farms is a 12.5-hectare mango orchard in the coastal province of Zambales, home of the Philippine Carabao Mango. The property was purchased in 1920 by David Jocson and Rosa Magsaysay. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 the whole place was buried in ash, leaving only a few surviving mango trees. David and Rosa's grandchildren faced the devastation with resilient spirit, they rehabilitated and develop the farm into a mango orchard. By 2011, the farm was renamed as Rosa Farms under the management of Ding and Nelda Zulueta. Today it is not just an ordinary mango orchard but an Agri-tourism destination, as well as a venue for team building and corporate events, camping and family outing, educational tours rest and recreation. ​</a>
