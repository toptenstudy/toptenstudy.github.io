                                            What two values of x make the product above equal to zero?
Plug each of these values into x2 + 3x + 2. What do you get?
The blue points are x-intercepts of the parabola. They are the points where y = 0. Mouseover the blue points. What is the x-coordinate of each point?
Plug each solution into x2 + 3x + 2. What do you get?
Recall that x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2). How do these factors relate to the x-intercepts of y = x^2 + 3x + 2?
The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of x that make the related function zero. The real roots are also the x-intercepts of the parabola. Look at the graph of y = x2 – 4x + 3.
How many roots does x2 – 4x + 3 = 0 have?
What are the roots?
Change c to 4.0. How many roots does x2 – 4x + 4 = 0 have?
Now graph y = x^2 – 4x + 8 in the Gizmo, and look at the resulting parabola. Do you think 
x^2 – 4x + 8 = 0 has any real roots? Explain. 
Vary the values of a, b, and c. In general, how many real roots are possible for a quadratic equation?
Graph y = x2 + 6x + 5. Turn on Show axis of symmetry x = –b/(2a). The axis of symmetry is a line that divides a parabola into two halves that are mirror images.
How does the location of the axis of symmetry relate to the location of the two 
x-intercepts?
Move the a, b, and c sliders. Which values affect the axis of symmetry? 
The equation of the axis of symmetry is x = . How does this explain what you observed above?
Suppose you know the line of symmetry for a quadratic function.
From just this information, can you find the x-intercepts?
Explain.
Suppose the axis of symmetry of the graph of a quadratic function is at x = 6. If one root of the related quadratic equation is –1.5, what is the other root?</a>

                                            Good day! For today, you will learn another way to organize data in a table. But this time you do not need to list all the
individual values but you only count the number of times the data appear in a data set.
Consider the tally sheets and board below and answer the questions that follow.
Tally Sheet for a Class Election
Do you still recall how the votes are counted during class elections?
Blank Tally Chart - Bing images
Tally Sheet for Local Election
Were you with your parents when they visited the school to take a vote for the
candidates during a barangay or municipal election?
Bing
Tally Board for the National Election
Have you ever watched how the votes of the national election are being
presented to many viewers?
election tally board - Bing images
It is important, during elections that the data or the count of votes are presented to the viewers in a way that they
can easily observe the status of the election results. Using a tally sheet or tally board is a way to organize the counting of
votes.
D. Development (Time Frame: 100 minutes)
WHAT IS FREQUENCY?
Frequency is the number of times an observation or a particular value appears in a data set.
WHAT IS FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION?
A frequency distribution is a table that shows the frequencies for the categories, values of a counting variable or class
intervals.
Let us consider the following portion of the table.
Class interval Tally Frequency
16 â€“ 20 IIII â€“ II 7
CLASS INTERVAL
In the table above, the class interval is 16 â€“ 20. Its class size is 5 because there are 5 values that the interval may contain,
specifically 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. â€‹</a>

Under the “new normal,” commercial aircraft would have to  limit passenger capacity in observance of physical distancing, in addition to a host of health and safety measures that they need to implement.But Lufthansa has pioneered an innovative way to be back in business without having to cut the numer of paying passengers for their flights.Germany’s largest airline has just unveiled a prototype of its new fleet that is three times the length of the Boeing 777 and can accommodate three times the number of passengers without violating established physical distancing protocols.Indeed for Lufthansa, it’s business as usual under the new normal!Link: https://adobochronicles.com/2020/06/11/lufthansa-unveils-new-normal-aircraft/1.Is the source reliable? 2.

                            13. What two values of x make the product above equal to zero?
Plug each of these values into x2 + 3x + 2. What do you get?
The blue points are x-intercepts of the parabola. They are the points where y = 0. Mouseover the blue points. What is the x-coordinate of each point?
Plug each solution into x2 + 3x + 2. What do you get?
Recall that x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2). How do these factors relate to the x-intercepts of y = x^2 + 3x + 2?
The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of x that make the related function zero. The real roots are also the x-intercepts of the parabola. Look at the graph of y = x2 – 4x + 3.
How many roots does x2 – 4x + 3 = 0 have?
What are the roots?
Change c to 4.0. How many roots does x2 – 4x + 4 = 0 have?
Now graph y = x^2 – 4x + 8 in the Gizmo, and look at the resulting parabola. Do you think 
x^2 – 4x + 8 = 0 has any real roots? Explain. 
Vary the values of a, b, and c. In general, how many real roots are possible for a quadratic equation?
Graph y = x2 + 6x + 5. Turn on Show axis of symmetry x = –b/(2a). The axis of symmetry is a line that divides a parabola into two halves that are mirror images.
How does the location of the axis of symmetry relate to the location of the two 
x-intercepts?
Move the a, b, and c sliders. Which values affect the axis of symmetry? 
The equation of the axis of symmetry is x = . How does this explain what you observed above?
Suppose you know the line of symmetry for a quadratic function.
From just this information, can you find the x-intercepts?
Explain.
Suppose the axis of symmetry of the graph of a quadratic function is at x = 6. If one root of the related quadratic equation is –1.5, what is the other root?</h2><br />

WHAT IS FREQUENCY?
Frequency is the number of times an observation or a particular value appears in a data set.
WHAT IS FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION?
A frequency distribution is a table that shows the frequencies for the categories, values of a counting variable or class
intervals.
Let us consider the following portion of the table.
Class interval Tally Frequency
16 â€“ 20 IIII â€“ II 7
CLASS INTERVAL
In the table above, the class interval is 16 â€“ 20. Its class size is 5 because there are 5 values that the interval may contain,
specifically 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. â€‹</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When the mean is computed for individual data, all values in the data set are used. 14. A single, extremely large value can affect the median more than the mean. 15. One-half of all the data values will fall above the mode, and one-half will fall below the mode 16. In a data set, the mode will always be unique.
