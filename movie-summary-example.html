                                            Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</a>

In 2015, people around the world spent $111 billion on home electronic fun, such as software, game consoles and accessories as well as mobile and on-line options like apps, subscriptions, and digital content. It's a large, important, worldwide industry that has been around for just about 25 years. The gaming sector, often called the interactive entertainment industry, may be young but it's financially more successful than the world's most famous entertainment technology, movies, which had revenues of $39 billion last year. In addition, games are also bigger than older global industries like wine production ($60 billion) and music ($15 billion). In conclusion, the video game entertainment industry is big business and looks to become even bigger as experts say it could grow to $150 billion by 2020 because of developments in reality and virtual markets.

                            7. Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two types of syntheses: explanatory syntheses and argumentative syntheses. Explanatory syntheses seek to bring sources together to explain a perspective and the reasoning behind it. Argumentative syntheses seek to bring sources together to make an argument. Both types of synthesis involve looking for relationships between sources and drawing conclusions.</p><p>In order to successfully synthesize your sources, you might begin by grouping your sources by topic and looking for connections. For example, if you were researching the pros and cons of encouraging healthy eating in children, you would want to separate your sources to find which ones agree with each other and which ones disagree.</p><p>After you have a good idea of what your sources are saying, you want to construct your body paragraphs in a way that acknowledges different sources and highlights where you can draw new conclusions.</p><p></p><br />

In 2015, people around the world spent $111 billion on home electronic fun, such as software, game consoles and accessories as well as mobile and on-line options like apps, subscriptions, and digital content. It's a large, important, worldwide industry that has been around for just about 25 years. The gaming sector, often called the interactive entertainment industry, may be young but it's financially more successful than the world's most famous entertainment technology, movies, which had revenues of $39 billion last year. In addition, games are also bigger than older global industries like wine production ($60 billion) and music ($15 billion). In conclusion, the video game entertainment industry is big business and looks to become even bigger as experts say it could grow to $150 billion by 2020 because of developments in reality and virtual markets.
