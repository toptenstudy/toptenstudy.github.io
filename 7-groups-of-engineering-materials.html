                                            CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</a>

                            9. CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</h2><br />
