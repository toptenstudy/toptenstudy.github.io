                                            Communication Skills of Deaf Students in the Undergraduate Program in Quezon, Philippines. Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

                                            I NEED HELP ASAP
In the 1800s, the United States was still a very young nation, trying to solidify its identity. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, a fast development of society following the introduction of machines. The United States was slower than Great Britain to fully embrace the changes. Yet key technological developments caused a rapid growth in American urban areas.
Better farming methods and tools in the 1800s increased food production. Americans were able to grow enough food for their families as well as to sell. The abundance caused food prices to fall.
The expansion of cotton and the growth of textile factories in northern states helped produce the first wave of American industry. More people turned to work in northern factories as a way to support their families. Thousands of immigrants to the United States also settled in or near port cities, looking for work. Even today, the need for work is a common reason people move to urban areas.
As a result, cities grew in numbers of people and physical space. As more people and businesses moved in, they needed buildings for living and working. They needed ways to move around the city. We call this process urbanization.
In 1820, the United States had only a few cities of 10,000 residents or more. About seven percent of U.S. residents lived in urban areas. The number of cities with more than 10,000 people grew quickly over the next 40 years, especially in the Northeast and Midwest. By 1860, about 20 percent lived in cities. Philadelphia and New York City were the most populated cities in 1860 and would soon reach one million residents.
The urbanization of the United States quickened due to technology improvements. Without innovations in food production, the factories could not have grown so quickly. The trend quickened after 1860 and continued throughout the 21st century as well. By 2007, more Americans lived in or near cities than they did in rural areas.

                                            The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</a>

                            4. Communication Skills of Deaf Students in the Undergraduate Program in Quezon, Philippines. Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />

A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

                            26. I NEED HELP ASAP
In the 1800s, the United States was still a very young nation, trying to solidify its identity. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, a fast development of society following the introduction of machines. The United States was slower than Great Britain to fully embrace the changes. Yet key technological developments caused a rapid growth in American urban areas.
Better farming methods and tools in the 1800s increased food production. Americans were able to grow enough food for their families as well as to sell. The abundance caused food prices to fall.
The expansion of cotton and the growth of textile factories in northern states helped produce the first wave of American industry. More people turned to work in northern factories as a way to support their families. Thousands of immigrants to the United States also settled in or near port cities, looking for work. Even today, the need for work is a common reason people move to urban areas.
As a result, cities grew in numbers of people and physical space. As more people and businesses moved in, they needed buildings for living and working. They needed ways to move around the city. We call this process urbanization.
In 1820, the United States had only a few cities of 10,000 residents or more. About seven percent of U.S. residents lived in urban areas. The number of cities with more than 10,000 people grew quickly over the next 40 years, especially in the Northeast and Midwest. By 1860, about 20 percent lived in cities. Philadelphia and New York City were the most populated cities in 1860 and would soon reach one million residents.
The urbanization of the United States quickened due to technology improvements. Without innovations in food production, the factories could not have grown so quickly. The trend quickened after 1860 and continued throughout the 21st century as well. By 2007, more Americans lived in or near cities than they did in rural areas.

                            28. The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</h2><br />
