                            16. HOMEROOM GUIDANCE
Write an essay about a current situation where students like you should learn to appreciate the benefits of respect in promoting healthy relationships. The essay must contain a minimum of 3-4 paragraphs.​​
 Answer: Many students deserved to be appreciated and be respected, 
either I really don't get too much respect from others. 
we should respect and appreciated those who are older than us.
People should learn to appreciate the benefits of respect 
in building healthy relationships because as we portray and 
empower respect, we get to nurture our relationships and make 
it more lasting and purposeful. 
As we show respect, we could do something altruistic for them 
to still belong in the new education setting and help them 
reach their goals and dreams for their better future.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Promoting a healthy relationship must empower the importance of respect – respect for individuality, humanity, differences, and regardless of the person’s origin, beliefs, and principles.  Respect should be genuinely offered more than earned because how we want to be treated must first reflect on our behavior and manners.  However, this does not guarantee another person’s reciprocity which is why respect must be inculcated or instilled individually.</p><br />
