However, upon investigation, it was disclosed that its income tax return was false or fraudulent because it did not report a taxable income amounting to another P200,000. The BIR informed ABC through a Preliminary Assessment Notice but it failed to protest on time; hence, a formal letter of demand and assessment notice was issued on July 1, 2020 calling for payment of the deficiency income tax on or before July 31, 2020.

He set his objective which is to describe the experiencesof tricycle drivers. To accomplish the goal, he established his plans on how to collectdata. He decided to conduct Interviews with them. He politely asked permission from thedrivers to conduct the interviews and to have an audio recording. He also assured themof the confidentality of their identity through a signed agreement. He explained to themthe purposes of theinterview.After that, he listened to the audio recordings at home and transcribed them (thismeans he converted the interview into writing). He analyzed the interviews by readingthe transcription again and again, then made a table that summarized the result of hisinterviews. He kept all the records he had in case he will need them to verify the results.He also made sure he did not add his personal opinion in the results to avoid bias.He wrote his research report, read it and made revisions. After finalizing the report,he published it.Case 2Juan was tasked to conduct a qualitative research and he chose online sellers inKidapawan City as his sublects. He set his main objectives which are to describe howonline sellers do their business and to describe their experiences. He has planned toconduct interviews with them but since he felt tired of doing it, he invented the results ofthe research instead ond submitted the report to his teacher. Because of this he does nothave proofs of the investigation he conducted. Anyways, he knew online sellers and sawhow they live.Which one is a better research? Why?​</a>

Antibacterial activity of oak determined with disc diffusion test. Collecting the samples was done in Lorestan provenance, after that drying in shadow and extracting by rotary. Finally, the mere extract was poured in Petri dish and put in the refrigerator. Results of the study showed that the extract of oak leaf has antibacterial characteristics against the bacteria presented in the research.2. Overall, the study was conducted successfully.

ITO PO UNG ARTICLE The rigid mothodology in recent COVID-19 vaccinations istruly praiseworthy. VWe seo whole of syslem, wholo of governmentand whole of society approaches covering overy aspoct from arivalof vaccines to deployment to LGUs nationwide. This includes maslerprofiling of each eligible candidate for vaccination, caroful selection ofvaccinators, strict injection prolocols, and adverse roactionsmonitoning and evaluation.As of Monday, government says 29,266 of the total 2million medical front liners have been vaccinated nationwide. So farwe received a donation of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac,while 525,000 doses of AstraZeneca had been delivered through theCOVAX facility of the World Health Organization. Another 1.4 milliondoses of Sinovac will arrive on March 21 under a government supplyagreement.Actually, the sight of "efficient" and fully networked "massvaccinations today of Sinovac and AstraZeneca brings back ournation's horrible experience with the 2016 school-based massvaccinaton by then DOH-DEPED of a similar "under clinicaltrials" Dengvaxia vaccine to 833,000 elementary students.On hindsight, the Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine was notthe mistake since it was finally approved for permanent use by theregulatory agencies of US, European Union and 19 other countries in2018.In the April 2016 school-based vaccinations, there were nopre-injection processing of students to determine if they have existingmedical conditons or co-morbidities. Even "vaccinators" were notcarefuly selected and there was no monitoring of adverse reactionsof inoculated students. Finally, there was no master list of the totalnumber of inoculated students in both DEPED and DOH.Because of this, there had been reports of elementarystudents who died allegedly after geting the first dose in August2016. In the ensuing Senate investigation, an officer of SanofPharmaceuticals even "apologized" for exposing the children to apossible "severe disease."Clearly, it was the nushed and haphazad vaccination ofDengvaxa by the paat Aquino administraton that created the cha0sthe exact opposite of today's DOH vaccinations The big questionstll ingers, why did the oulgoing Aquino adminisiralion launch theirschool-based Dengvaxia vaccination, wilth only two monlh beforethey left office in 2016?COVID-19 situation in PHAs government speeds up vaccination of 1.7 million medical frontiners nationwide, it is necessary to inform everyone on how ourcountry's COVID-19 situation compares worldwide in terms of casesand deaths per 1-nillion population.I think we are doing groat, despite nogative/alarmist news,according to the latest worldometer.com info website. We are number129 out of 219 countries worldwide with only 5,376 total cases perour 1-million population. In ASEAN, we are third to Singapore whichleads with 10,207 cases per million while Malaysia is second with9,601 cases per million. Indonesia is close fourth with 5,008 casesper million with Sri Lanka fifth at 3,991 per million.Rich and medically advanced countries such as USA is atnumber 8 (89,359), Spain at number 19 (67,334) Switzerland atnumber 23 (64,648), UK at number 25 (61,919) and France atnumber 27 (59,723).In terms of deaths per million, we are at number 118 out of 219countries with only 113 deaths per 1-million population. Indonesialeads ASEAN with 135 deaths while Malaysia has 36 deaths, SriLanka, 23 deaths and Singapore at 5 deaths per 1-million.United Kingdom is at number 6 worldwide (1,827 deaths), Italy isnumber 8 (1,652 deaths), USA at number 11 (1,618 deaths), Spanat number 15 (1,521) and Mexico at number 16 (1,468 deaths permillion)These numbers speak the truth that since the pandemic outbre=last year, and whether there was a surge or spike happening, ourcountry is still in a far better situation than others in this planet.​</a>

The study reports on the antibacterial activity of extract taken from the leaf of oak (Querctis persica) against two positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and two negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria. Antibacterial activity of oak determined with disc diffusion test. Collecting the samples was done in Lorestan provenance, after that drying in shadow and extracting by rotary. Finally, the mere extract was poured in Petri dish and put in the refrigerator. Results of the study showed that the extract of oak leaf has antibacterial characteristics against the bacteria presented in the research.2. Overall, the study was conducted successfully. As recommended by the researchers, further studies must be conducted to identify the most important material in the oak leaf that has the most antibacterial characteristics3. The study was clearly presented. The methodology was accurate and the results were reliable and valid4 International Journal of Farming and Allied Sciences (2013) Antibacterial Activity of Leaves Extract from Oak (Quercus persicol Against Some Positive and Negative Bacteria.

He politely asked permission from thedrivers to conduct the interviews and to have an audio recording. He also assured themof the confidentality of their identity through a signed agreement. He explained to themthe purposes of theinterview.After that, he listened to the audio recordings at home and transcribed them (thismeans he converted the interview into writing). He analyzed the interviews by readingthe transcription again and again, then made a table that summarized the result of hisinterviews. He kept all the records he had in case he will need them to verify the results.He also made sure he did not add his personal opinion in the results to avoid bias.He wrote his research report, read it and made revisions. After finalizing the report,he published it.Case 2Juan was tasked to conduct a qualitative research and he chose online sellers inKidapawan City as his sublects.

The final research report where a discussion of findings and limitation ispresented is the easiest part of a research.2. Research methods can be selected by a researcher prior to formulating theresearch objectives.3. Most areas of study have to deal with processes that involve experimentations,tests, and research.4. Quantitative data will tell you what your respondents are doing, while qualitativedata offers deeper insight into why.5. Quantitative research is original, systematic and objective research that collectsnumerical data and uses logic and statistical analysis to verify hypothesis.6. A researcher should explore the characteristics of the data and the examinedvariables to summarize the data once it is reliable and ready for investigation.7. Quantitative research uses statistics to generalize a finding.8. The first step for a researcher after finishing data collection is to start hypothesistesting procedures.9.

ITO PO UNG ARTICLE The rigid mothodology in recent COVID-19 vaccinations istruly praiseworthy. VWe seo whole of syslem, wholo of governmentand whole of society approaches covering overy aspoct from arivalof vaccines to deployment to LGUs nationwide. This includes maslerprofiling of each eligible candidate for vaccination, caroful selection ofvaccinators, strict injection prolocols, and adverse roactionsmonitoning and evaluation.As of Monday, government says 29,266 of the total 2million medical front liners have been vaccinated nationwide. So farwe received a donation of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac,while 525,000 doses of AstraZeneca had been delivered through theCOVAX facility of the World Health Organization. Another 1.4 milliondoses of Sinovac will arrive on March 21 under a government supplyagreement.Actually, the sight of "efficient" and fully networked "massvaccinations today of Sinovac and AstraZeneca brings back ournation's horrible experience with the 2016 school-based massvaccinaton by then DOH-DEPED of a similar "under clinicaltrials" Dengvaxia vaccine to 833,000 elementary students.On hindsight, the Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine was notthe mistake since it was finally approved for permanent use by theregulatory agencies of US, European Union and 19 other countries in2018.In the April 2016 school-based vaccinations, there were nopre-injection processing of students to determine if they have existingmedical conditons or co-morbidities. Even "vaccinators" were notcarefuly selected and there was no monitoring of adverse reactionsof inoculated students. Finally, there was no master list of the totalnumber of inoculated students in both DEPED and DOH.Because of this, there had been reports of elementarystudents who died allegedly after geting the first dose in August2016. In the ensuing Senate investigation, an officer of SanofPharmaceuticals even "apologized" for exposing the children to apossible "severe disease."Clearly, it was the nushed and haphazad vaccination ofDengvaxa by the paat Aquino administraton that created the cha0sthe exact opposite of today's DOH vaccinations The big questionstll ingers, why did the oulgoing Aquino adminisiralion launch theirschool-based Dengvaxia vaccination, wilth only two monlh beforethey left office in 2016?COVID-19 situation in PHAs government speeds up vaccination of 1.7 million medical frontiners nationwide, it is necessary to inform everyone on how ourcountry's COVID-19 situation compares worldwide in terms of casesand deaths per 1-nillion population.I think we are doing groat, despite nogative/alarmist news,according to the latest worldometer.com info website. We are number129 out of 219 countries worldwide with only 5,376 total cases perour 1-million population. In ASEAN, we are third to Singapore whichleads with 10,207 cases per million while Malaysia is second with9,601 cases per million. Indonesia is close fourth with 5,008 casesper million with Sri Lanka fifth at 3,991 per million.Rich and medically advanced countries such as USA is atnumber 8 (89,359), Spain at number 19 (67,334) Switzerland atnumber 23 (64,648), UK at number 25 (61,919) and France atnumber 27 (59,723).In terms of deaths per million, we are at number 118 out of 219countries with only 113 deaths per 1-million population. Indonesialeads ASEAN with 135 deaths while Malaysia has 36 deaths, SriLanka, 23 deaths and Singapore at 5 deaths per 1-million.United Kingdom is at number 6 worldwide (1,827 deaths), Italy isnumber 8 (1,652 deaths), USA at number 11 (1,618 deaths), Spanat number 15 (1,521) and Mexico at number 16 (1,468 deaths permillion)These numbers speak the truth that since the pandemic outbre=last year, and whether there was a surge or spike happening, ourcountry is still in a far better situation than others in this planet.​</h2><br />
