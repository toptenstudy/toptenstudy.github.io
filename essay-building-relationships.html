                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            From an essay... "Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them."

It seemed to be sobeneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act(similarly. For children,having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, imate for sharingnumerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help inthe time of need. Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remainstangiyatatamaran​</a>

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors.

Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part.

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn! Use the outline below to write an informative essay about a Filipino trait of your choice. You may use a separate sheet of paper for your answer.

Building a positive relationship with your subordinates creates an environment as a manager where your subordinates are willing to work and put in the effort in their work to be successful. The key to building positive relationships is effective communication. Effective communication conveys your goals and paths to those goals with all of your subordinates, superiors, and peers. The benefits of effective face to face communication is immense not only does it build relationships, but it helps individuals get a understanding of the task at hand as well as the desired outcomes of those tasks.</p><br />

                            3. Identify ways on how to build healthy relationship with others? essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Accept and celebrate differences. One of the biggest challenges we experience in relationships is that we are all different. We can perceive the world in many ways. Certainly astumbling block that we come across when we try to build relationships is a desire or an expectation that people will think like we do and, in this way, it is so much easier to create a rapport. We feel more comfortable when we feel that people “get” us and can see our point of view. Life, however, would be very dull if we were all the same and, while we may find it initially easier, the novelty of sameness soon would wear off. So accepting and celebrating that we are all different is a great starting point.</p><p></p><p>2. Listen effectively. Listening is a crucial skill in boosting another person’s self-esteem, the silent form of flattery that makes people feel supported and valued. Listening and understanding what others communicate to us is the most important part of successful interaction and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>Active or reflective listening is the single most useful and important listening skill. In active listening, we also are genuinely interested in understanding what the other person is thinking, feeling, wanting, or what the message means, and we are active in checking out our understanding before we respond with our own new message. We restate or paraphrase our understanding of their message and reflect it back to the sender for verification. This verification or feedback process is what distinguishes active listening and makes it effective.</p><p></p><p>3. Give people your time. Giving time to people is also a huge gift. In a world where time is of the essence and we are trying to fit in more than one lifetime, we don’t always have the time to give to our loved ones, friends, and work colleagues. Technology has somewhat eroded our ability to build real rapport and we attempt to multi-task by texting and talking at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Being present in the time you give to people is also important, so that, when you are with someone, you are truly with someone and not dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. The connection we make with other people is the verytouchstone of our existence, and devoting time, energy, and effort to developing and building relationships is one of the most valuable life skills.</p><p></p><p>4. Develop your communication skills. Communication occurs when someone understands you, not just when you speak. One of the biggest dangers with communication is that we can work on the assumption that the other person has understood the message we are trying to get across.</p><p></p><p>Poor communication in the workplace can lead to a culture of back stabbing and blame, which, in turn, can affect our stress levels, especially when we don’t understand something or feel we have been misled. It also can have a positive effect on morale when it works well and motivates individuals to want to come into work and do a great job.</p><p></p><p>5. Manage mobile technology. By now, pretty much everyone has a mobile phone and many people have two or more. While they are a lifesaver in an emergency, and an effective tool for communication, they also can be a complete distraction when people exhibit a lack of mobile phone etiquette.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>: )</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. respect.

                            4. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            6. From an essay... "Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them."

It seemed to be sobeneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act(similarly. For children,having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, imate for sharingnumerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help inthe time of need. Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remainstangiyatatamaran​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>There are many different ways to build many different kinds of relationships. When you are building a relationship for the purpose of obtaining customers for your business, it is important to remember to be yourself. Your ultimate goal should be to create a long-term relationship with the person because this is how loyal customer is made and a loyal customer is a return customer. I believe the three most important techniques for building a long-term loyal customer are building rapport, working the person’s family, home life, and hobbies into the general conversation, and always keep eye contact and never forget to begin and end with a firm hand shake. Rapport is the ability to relate to others in a way that creates trust and understanding. It is important to build rapport with your customers, as it gets there unconscious mind to accept your suggestions.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> IT'S</strong><strong> HELPING</strong><strong> PO</strong><strong> ☺️</strong><strong>☺️</strong></p><p>need points by the way</p><p>and subscribe to MrZiajianGuy</p><br />

                            23. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />

 Answer: Many students deserved to be appreciated and be respected,

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Promoting a healthy relationship must empower the importance of respect – respect for individuality, humanity, differences, and regardless of the person’s origin, beliefs, and principles.  Respect should be genuinely offered more than earned because how we want to be treated must first reflect on our behavior and manners.  However, this does not guarantee another person’s reciprocity which is why respect must be inculcated or instilled individually.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As humans, we are constantly building relationships with others and meeting new people, but sometimes it 's hard to maintain a relationship with another person, when only one person is engaged in it. All healthy relationships or friendships should be based upon the concepts of caring, supporting, and spending time with each other, and if one person is not able to provide these concepts towards the other person, then the relationship quickly becomes one-sided. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Caring for the other partner is one of the most important elements of any healthy relationship. I am always trying to find ways to spend time with my freind , Isabella, but she just always seems to find the perfect excuse to ditch out on our plans at the last minute. I asked her if she would like to go to the Creekview football game, and she said she was down, but</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It’s basically the equivalence of not having a friend. I’ve asked Isabella to hang out with me many times, but she always says she’s really busy and can’t make it, and i 'm understanding towards her situation, but it becomes so consistent, that I begin to wonder if she actually is busy.  Of course, I have a choice to not put as much effort into the friendship or just simply end the friendship, but I would much rather give her a chance and see how far the relationship lasts on current terms. After all, I don’t completely know what goes on in her life and whether she’s doing this on purpose or not, so it would not be fair to her to just end the friendship on my behalf. I’ll always be the one who tries to work things out in the relationship and compromise with what we have until there is nothing left to work with, but it gets beyond irritating when her lack of effort is more noticeable as our friendship</p><p></p><br />
