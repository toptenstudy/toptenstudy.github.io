Your attitude and behavior contributes to a successful and positive course experience. It is therefore important for each student to take an active role in her/his learning. It may be difficult or uncomfortable for you to actively participate in class discussions and small group activities at first. However, it is one of the most important skills to learn at the university. It is important to note that you get out of a course what you put into it. Students are encouraged to share academic needs, concerns, fears, challenges, and victories with their instructor and/or classmates. A course is much more rewarding if you fully participate. Each instructor takes her/his job seriously and is committed to helping all students to be successful. You are expected to adhere to the following standards of classroom performance and behavior to maximize learning.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>true ∆</p><p>        ll</p><p>        ll</p><p></p><p></p><p>ye he's true </p><p></p><p></p><p>brainliest him not me</p><p></p><br />
