THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE One stormy day, a monkey was standing by the shore of a river, wondering how he could get over by himself, for the water was deep, and he did not know how to swim. He looked about for some logs, but all he saw was a large crocodile with its mouth wide open, ready to seize him. He was very frightened, but he said, “Oh Mr. Crocodile! Please, do not kill me! Spare my life, and I will lead you to a place where you can get as many monkeys as will feed you all your life.” The crocodile agreed, and the monkey said that the place was on the other side of the river. So, the crocodile told him to get on his back, and he would carry him across. Just before they reached the bank, the monkey jumped to land, ran as fast as he could, and climbed up the tree where his mate was. The crocodile could not follow, of course, so he returned to the water saying, “The time will come when you shall pay.” END.21-22. Who are the characters in the story? 23-24.

                                            The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</a>

They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell what you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.

THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE One stormy day, a monkey was standing by the shore of a river, wondering how he could get over by himself, for the water was deep, and he did not know how to swim. He looked about for some logs, but all he saw was a large crocodile with its mouth wide open, ready to seize him. He was very frightened, but he said, “Oh Mr. Crocodile! Please, do not kill me! Spare my life, and I will lead you to a place where you can get as many monkeys as will feed you all your life.” The crocodile agreed, and the monkey said that the place was on the other side of the river. So, the crocodile told him to get on his back, and he would carry him across. Just before they reached the bank, the monkey jumped to land, ran as fast as he could, and climbed up the tree where his mate was. The crocodile could not follow, of course, so he returned to the water saying, “The time will come when you shall pay.” END.21-22. Who are the characters in the story? 23-24.

                            2. The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This Ibaloy tale is structured in a traditional folktale format, beginning with the introduction of two blind women who are poor and must beg for food. The plot then follows their journey to the next village, where they encounter a magical rock that opens up and reveals an old woman who gives them a sack of rice and bottle of water that will never be empty or drained dry. The story ends with the two women sharing their good fortune with others by sowing some of the rice and pouring out some of the water, which turns into small streams. </p><p></p><p>The point of view is third person omniscient, as it allows readers to understand what is happening from both characters' perspectives. The major characters are the two blind women, while minor characters include the old woman from within the rock and those in their village who benefit from their generosity. </p><p></p><p>The actions taken by these characters include walking to another village, bumping into a large rock, being given food by an old woman inside it, receiving gifts from her (a sack of rice and bottle of water), returning home happily together afterwards, sowing some grain from one's sack and pouring out some water from one's bottle so that it turns into small streams for others to use. </p><p></p><p>Literary devices used in this story include imagery (the hilly paths they walk on) as well as personification (the rock opening magically). These devices help create meaning by providing vivid descriptions that bring life to this tale about how kindness can be rewarded through generosity towards others.</p><br />
