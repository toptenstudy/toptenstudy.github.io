Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

And it is no wonder, as the ability to categorise and compare things in terms of their differences and similarities corresponds to some the earliest stages of cognitive development. Without the ability to group things effectively in terms of their similarities and differences, much of what we consider as ‘learning’ would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>compare_and_contrast_reading.png</p><p>Defining the Terms Compare and Contrast</p><p></p><p>The ability to compare and contrast has its uses far beyond the classroom. WIth practical applications in everything from choosing which insurance policy to buy, to what clothes to pack for a holiday, comparing and contrasting are requirements for much of our everyday decision-making. However, when we discuss these terms in relation to reading skills, they have much more specific meanings.</p><p></p><p>Compare, in relation to reading, refers to the process of identifying the similarities and differences between two things. On the other hand, Contrast refers to identifying only the differences between two things. While the distinction between these two terms may appear on the surface to be quite subtle, it is important that students can accurately differentiate between the two concepts to ensure they are able to answer questions and prompts accurately.</p><p></p><p>Importance of Teaching Comparative Thinking</p><p></p><p>Compare and contrast type questions are commonly featured in standardized tests, but there are many more reasons for students to develop their comparative thinking skills than just passing tests. A few of the most compelling reasons include:</p><p></p><p>●     These types of questions serve as good introductions for students to begin developing higher-order thinking skills</p><p></p><p>●     Answering compare and contrast questions helps students focus closely on the details in a text while improving their comprehension in the process</p><p></p><p>●     The attention to detail required in reading to compare and contrast helps students to better retain the information they are reading</p><p></p><p>●     Knowledge gained through comparing and contrasting helps students understand how to organize information, think more clearly, and express ideas more effectively in their own writing</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainlyiest heart and follow</p><br />

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />
