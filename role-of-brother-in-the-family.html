To motivate Trevor, Cady kept on trying to convince him about and kept talking about the beautiful beaches they can go to and the activities they can enjoy.

Trevor kept putting off his assignment until summer vacation is almost over, the whole family were not able to go out of town because they started preparing to get back to work or because of other activities.

                            30. Cady got a promotion and would like to treat her family to a luxurious vacation.  She planned to bring her family to the beach.  Everyone was excited except Trevor-her brother.  Trevor doesn’t like going to the beach and prefers going to cold place like Baguio.  To motivate Trevor, Cady kept on trying to convince him about and kept talking about the beautiful beaches they can go to and the activities they can enjoy.  Also, she assigned him as the person to book them their rooms.  She thought making Trevor more involved in planning will change his mind.  Trevor kept putting off his assignment until summer vacation is almost over, the whole family were not able to go out of town because they started preparing to get back to work or because of other activities.  Cady was really mad because Trevor did not do his assigned role.  What communication barrier happened in this situation? </h2><br />
