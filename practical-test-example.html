Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1)gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2)new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6)old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!</a>

                                            Worksheet on Divisibility Rules Search Worksheet on divisibility rules will help us to practice different types of questions on test of divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. We need to use the divisibility rules to find whether the given number is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. A quick way to find factors of larger numbers is to perform divisibility test. There are certain rules to check divisibility of numbers. Divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2, if the digit at ones place is an even number, that is the number ends in 0, 2, 4 or 8. For example, 100, 222, 344, 1658 are divisible by 2.​</a>

• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1)gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2)new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6)old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!</h2><br />

• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .
