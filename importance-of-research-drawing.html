                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Research is important and applicable in everyday life in various situations such as:Finding the best products or services to buy based on reviews and ratingsGathering information before making important decisions such as choosing a college or career pathConducting surveys to understand the opinions and preferences of a group of peopleInvestigating the causes and effects of a problem, and finding solutions to address Learning new things and discovering new knowledge through scientific researchThe Code of Ethics is important in doing a research study to ensure that the study is conducted ethically, responsibly, and with integrity. Following the policies in the Code of Ethics is necessary to protect the rights and welfare of the participants, maintain the trustworthiness and credibility of the study, and prevent any negative consequences that may arise from unethical practices. All the policies need to be followed to ensure that the research study is conducted with high ethical standards.If research were to be compared to a thing, it could be compared to a puzzle. Like a puzzle, research involves collecting and analyzing various pieces of information, connecting them together to form a coherent picture or understanding of a topic, and finding the missing pieces to complete the puzzleI do not have personal interests or aspirations. However, some common interests and aspirations of grade 11 learners may include pursuing higher education, developing skills in a particular field or activity, exploring new hobbies, and preparing for future careers.Qualitative research is the type of research that I would like to work on, and my tentative topic is "The lived experiences of immigrants in a foreign country." Some questions that I would like to ask about the topic include:<p>Question 1: What are the common challenges and difficulties that immigrants face when adjusting to a new country?</p><p>Question 2: How do immigrants cope with the cultural differences and barriers in the new environment?</p><p>Question 3: What support systems are available for immigrants to help them integrate into the new society?</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Situations wherein research is important and applicable in everyday life:</p><p>When making purchasing decisions: Researching the features, quality, and price of a product can help you make an informed decision.</p><p>When seeking medical treatment: Researching medical conditions and treatment options can help you understand your options and make informed decisions about your health.</p><p>When planning a trip: Researching travel destinations, accommodations, and activities can help you plan a safe and enjoyable trip.</p><p>When pursuing higher education: Researching colleges, universities, and academic programs can help you make informed decisions about your education and future career.</p><p>When making financial decisions: Researching investment options, loans, and credit cards can help you make smart financial decisions.</p><p>2. The Code of Ethics is important in doing a research study because it helps ensure that the study is conducted ethically, fairly, and with the welfare of the participants in mind. All policies should be followed to ensure that the research is conducted in a way that is consistent with ethical principles and guidelines. Failure to follow the policies may result in ethical violations and harm to the participants or the research itself.</p><p></p><p>3.If I were to compare research to a thing, it would be a magnifying glass. Research, like a magnifying glass, allows us to examine and investigate things in greater detail and uncover hidden information or insights. Just as a magnifying glass can help us see things more clearly, research can help us gain a deeper understanding of a topic or phenomenon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.
