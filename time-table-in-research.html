                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is simple random sampling because the researcher chose each name on the list randomly without any specific pattern.</p><p></p><p>2. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is systematic random sampling because the subjects were selected by choosing every kth subject, where k was determined using a random starting point.</p><p></p><p>3. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is cluster sampling because the researcher interviewed people from each town in the province, which can be considered as a cluster.</p><p></p><p>4. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is systematic random sampling because the researcher interviewed every 10th student entering the gate.</p><p></p><p>5. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is stratified random sampling because the researcher selected a sample from each category (high school degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree).</p><p></p><p>6. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is simple random sampling because the researcher randomly selected a sample from the population.</p><p></p><p>7. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is purposive sampling because the researcher interviewed all top 10 Grade 11 students in each of 15 schools in Capiz.</p><p></p><p>8. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is simple random sampling because the researcher randomly selected 10 barangays from the town.</p><p></p><p>9. The sampling technique used by the teacher in this situation is random sampling because the students were asked to fall in line randomly.</p><p></p><p>10. The sampling technique used by the researcher in this situation is systematic random sampling because the subjects were selected by choosing every kth subject.</p><p></p><p>11. The sampling technique used by the teacher in this situation is stratified random sampling because the students were divided into male and female, and then a sample was selected from each group.</p><p></p><p>12.
