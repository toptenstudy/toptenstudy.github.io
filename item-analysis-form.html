                        A PUBLIC POST IS NOT A HEREDITARY CROWN<p></p><p>According to my understanding of the caricature, the situation involves a political dynasty because one man wants to <strong>transfer</strong> the throne to another man, while another man wearing "salakot and barong tagalog" is attempting to prevent the transfer. It means that because he is unique, a well-known and respected individual cannot <strong>transfer</strong> his position to other people. His charismatic appeal to others is different.</p><p></p>A CARICATURE POSTED ON MAY 20, 1916<p></p>Based on what I read, the caricature shows a politician in Tondo named Dr. Santos and he is giving the crown to his brother in law named Dr. Barcelona. During the transfer of  throne, Santos was being stopped by a Filipino man wearing a salakot and barong tagalog who told him to stop gifting Barcelona the crown because it was never his to begin with.Most politicians are creating political dynasties so they can pass on or provide government positions to family members in order to increase and strengthen their hold on power.<p>What is political dynasty? : brainly.ph/question/551262</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
