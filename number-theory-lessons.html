                                            There are many different theories which explain how different life forms exist. In the mid-18th century, most people believed in creationism. Creationism held the idea that all forms of life were created in its present form and they remain unchanged since the beginning. Do you know that even the famous Carl von Linnaeus, the Father of Taxonomy, belleved in the fixity of species? (Source: Biology M15 Evolution, page 5) From the last lesson, we learned that fossil records, and developmental and molecular biology are possible evidences of evolution. To prove that evolution did exist, scientists travelled and explore the world and came up with their own theories. One of these is Charles Darwin Below is a story of Charles Darwin's journey in his voyage to Galapagos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Read the paragraph and try to answer the questions below. A long time ago, a small flock of sporrow-like birds called finches were blown out to sea by a fierce storm They lost their bearings but flew on in search of the mainlond, going further and further out to sea. At the point of exhaustion, 600 miles from home, they spotted a speck of land - an island in the middle of the sea. They were saved and could rest, drink and feed before returning home But this island was perfect: It had abundant seeds and other food, plenty of shelter, nesting sites and amazingly) no predators or other birds to compete with life was much harder on the mainland. There was no need for the birds to move on. Their numbers grew - until they became just a bit too numerous for the little island. Some found it hard to find enough food for themselves or their offspring, and young birds were driven away from areas where food was available. Some birds were forced to fly across the seo to nearby islands. There, they found new territories, also with no predators or other birds to compete with As the plants and their seeds were just a little different on each island, some birds were better than others at finding and eating the new food sources Birds which could break open fruits and eat the seeds survived well enough to produce lots of babies. Eventually, after a very long time, all the islands became occupied by these birds but the finches on each island were shghtly different Learning Task 1. Guide Questions: 1. Explain why it is unlikely that more than one flock of birds would find the islands in this way at the same time? 2. Suggest two possible reasons why there were no predators on the island 3. Why were there no other birds to compete with? (see 01) 4. Why might some finches survive better than others on the same food sources? 5. Why were the finches slightly different on each island?​</a>

                                            The development of the atomic theory began with intuitive thought, when early Greek philosophers pondered on the nature of matter. It took centuries to develop a complete picture of the atom. There had been various models suggested at different periods of time. These models represent concrete expressions of theoretical assumptions. In this lesson, you will learn the most significant discoveries of the structure of the atom which led to creation of the two models of the atom. What's In Directions: Identify which subatomic particles match each of these descriptions. In one of the numbers, the answer box will have more than one answer. Particle(s) Description 1. They have a relative charge of +1 2. They have a relative charge of -1 3. They have no charge - - 4. Located in the nucleus of an atom 5.

As the temperature rises, the molecules move 11. (faster, slower and therefore collide more and have greater chances to react with each other. 12-13. A 12.

                            5. There are many different theories which explain how different life forms exist. In the mid-18th century, most people believed in creationism. Creationism held the idea that all forms of life were created in its present form and they remain unchanged since the beginning. Do you know that even the famous Carl von Linnaeus, the Father of Taxonomy, belleved in the fixity of species? (Source: Biology M15 Evolution, page 5) From the last lesson, we learned that fossil records, and developmental and molecular biology are possible evidences of evolution. To prove that evolution did exist, scientists travelled and explore the world and came up with their own theories. One of these is Charles Darwin Below is a story of Charles Darwin's journey in his voyage to Galapagos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Read the paragraph and try to answer the questions below. A long time ago, a small flock of sporrow-like birds called finches were blown out to sea by a fierce storm They lost their bearings but flew on in search of the mainlond, going further and further out to sea. At the point of exhaustion, 600 miles from home, they spotted a speck of land - an island in the middle of the sea. They were saved and could rest, drink and feed before returning home But this island was perfect: It had abundant seeds and other food, plenty of shelter, nesting sites and amazingly) no predators or other birds to compete with life was much harder on the mainland. There was no need for the birds to move on. Their numbers grew - until they became just a bit too numerous for the little island. Some found it hard to find enough food for themselves or their offspring, and young birds were driven away from areas where food was available. Some birds were forced to fly across the seo to nearby islands. There, they found new territories, also with no predators or other birds to compete with As the plants and their seeds were just a little different on each island, some birds were better than others at finding and eating the new food sources Birds which could break open fruits and eat the seeds survived well enough to produce lots of babies. Eventually, after a very long time, all the islands became occupied by these birds but the finches on each island were shghtly different Learning Task 1. Guide Questions: 1. Explain why it is unlikely that more than one flock of birds would find the islands in this way at the same time? 2. Suggest two possible reasons why there were no predators on the island 3. Why were there no other birds to compete with? (see 01) 4. Why might some finches survive better than others on the same food sources? 5. Why were the finches slightly different on each island?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.

                            7. The development of the atomic theory began with intuitive thought, when early Greek philosophers pondered on the nature of matter. It took centuries to develop a complete picture of the atom. There had been various models suggested at different periods of time. These models represent concrete expressions of theoretical assumptions. In this lesson, you will learn the most significant discoveries of the structure of the atom which led to creation of the two models of the atom. What's In Directions: Identify which subatomic particles match each of these descriptions. In one of the numbers, the answer box will have more than one answer. Particle(s) Description 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Development of atomic theory</p><p>The concept of the atom that Western scientists accepted in broad outline from the 1600s until about 1900 originated with Greek philosophers in the 5th century BCE. Their speculation about a hard, indivisible fundamental particle of nature was replaced slowly by a scientific theory supported by experiment and mathematical deduction. It was more than 2,000 years before modern physicists realized that the atom is indeed divisible and that it is not hard, solid, or immutable.</p><p></p><p>The atomic philosophy of the early Greeks</p><p>Leucippus of Miletus (5th century BCE) is thought to have originated the atomic philosophy. His famous disciple, Democritus of Abdera, named the building blocks of matter atomos, meaning literally “indivisible,” about 430 BCE. Democritus believed that atoms were uniform, solid, hard, incompressible, and indestructible and that they</p><br />
