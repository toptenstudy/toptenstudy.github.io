    A crucial step in nation-building is exercising your right to choose the country’s leaders. However, you can only do that if you are a registered voter.
You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all the eligibility requirements. You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.
First, bring a valid ID to your local COMELEC office, or to satellite registration areas
in malls and barangays. Acceptable valid IDs are: Employee ID, with signature of employer or his/her authorized representative, Postal ID, Person with disability (PWD) discount ID, Student’s ID or library card, signed by school authority, Senior Citizen’s ID, Driver’s license, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, Passport, SSS/GSIS ID, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) ID, Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) license and/or For indigenous Filipinos, a Certificate of Confirmation issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). A cedula (community tax certificate) or police clearance will not be accepted as valid IDs.
Next, fill out 3 copies of the form to apply for registration. Get the forms from your local
COMELEC office, or download and print the application form from the COMELEC website. Senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and members of indigenous communities will fill out a Supplementary Data Form, and may be assisted by a qualified assistant.
  Finally, have your biometrics captured. COMELEC personnel will take your photograph, digital signature, and fingerprints. Keep the acknowledgment receipt. It is found at the bottom part of the application form. It will be detached by the COMELEC personnel and given to you.
Besides the registration of new applicants, the following voter-related services are also available: Transfer of Voter Registration Record, Reactivation of Voter Registration Record, Change of name due to marriage or court order, Correction of entries in Voter Registration Record, Reinstatement of name in the List of Voters and Inclusion of registration record in the Book of Voters. If you are unsure of the status of your voter registration or biometrics record, contact your local COMELEC office.</a>

First, the Article defines crimes of disloyalty as involving failures to prioritize one’s own country’s interests through participating in efforts to directly undermine core institutional resources the country requires to protect itself or otherwise advance its interests by force. Second, this Article canvasses various potential arguments for the existence of a duty not to be disloyal to one’s own country and argues that they fail. Finally, this Article argues that we should interpret the wrong of disloyalty crimes as involving not betrayal or infidelity, but transgression of political boundaries. That is, the relevant wrong here is rooted in the ideas of separation of powers and assignments of roles between citizens and the state, and we should thus conceive crimes of disloyalty as crimes of usurpation and evaluate the moral rights and wrongs of such crimes accordingly</p><p></p><p></p><br />
