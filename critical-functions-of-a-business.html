                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders.

                            7. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>here u go :) -Malong</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.2 Two types of goals in line with Anelisa's story are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Career goal: Anelisa's goal was to get into university and then find a job in a company that aligns with his values and beliefs. He achieved this goal by graduating from university and getting accepted into Engen's graduate development programme.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Personal growth goal: Anelisa's goal was to touch people's lives and assist them in the process of changing their own lives. This goal reflects his desire to make a positive impact on others and to contribute to making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.3 Three challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Childhood: Anelisa had a less than ideal childhood and had to bring himself up. This could have impacted his self-esteem and motivation.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Lack of family support: Anelisa received very little support from his family who lived in the Eastern Cape. This could have impacted his financial stability and made it harder for him to achieve his goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) Limited financial resources: Anelisa's uncle was a taxi driver and worked irregular hours. This could have made it difficult for him to pay for his education and other expenses.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.4 Anelisa's personal values contributed to his success in the following ways:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Determination: Anelisa's determination to succeed despite the challenges he faced showed his resilience and drive. He did not let his childhood or the lack of family support stop him from pursuing his goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Ambition: Anelisa had a clear plan and enough ambition to achieve his goals. He recognized the opportunities available to him and took advantage of them.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) Empathy: Anelisa's desire to touch people's lives and assist them in the process of changing their own lives reflects his empathy and compassion for others. This desire also shows his genuine concern for making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong>1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</strong></p><p><strong>Relationships can have a significant impact on the achievement of goals, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, supportive and encouraging relationships can provide motivation and inspiration, as well as resources and guidance, to help individuals reach their goals. On the other hand, negative relationships can impede progress and discourage individuals from pursuing their goals.</strong></p><br />
