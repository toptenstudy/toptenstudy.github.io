Learning Task 2. Identify the text structure of the following passages. Underline signal words and clues that helped you determine each structure.
_____________________1. Wild chimpanzees are rapidly disappearing. Some people are trying to solve this problem. Otherwise, chimpanzees may one day exist only in zoos. People are trying to save the rain forests and woodlands where
the chimps live from being cut down. It will take many people working together to solve this problem.
_____________________2. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they kiss and make up. When one chimpanzee comforts another, it gives it a hug or
pat on the back. There are, of course, many ways that chimpanzees and humans are different. Chimpanzees are smaller and stronger than humans. An adult male chimpanzee stands three or four feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. But a
chimpanzee can lift more weight than a man who is six feet tall.
_____________________3. Chimps live in groups and like each other a lot, but sometimes they fight. Because they don’t want to stay angry at each other after a fight, they make up by holding a hand out to the other and kissing. They show
they are sorry with pats and hugs. Then the anger goes away.
_____________________4. A chimpanzee’s body is made for climbing and swinging in the trees. First, it uses its long arms to reach a branch. Next, with its flexible hands and feet, it grabs and hooks on to the branch. Finally, it swings from that branch to another branch of tree.
_____________________5. It is fun to read about chimpanzees. All wild chimpanzees live in Africa. They live mostly in thick rain forests and in woodlands. There are two types, or species, of chimpanzees—the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimpanzee.</a>

Learning Task 2. Identify the text structure of the following passages. Underline signal words and clues that helped you determine each structure.
_____________________1. Wild chimpanzees are rapidly disappearing. Some people are trying to solve this problem. Otherwise, chimpanzees may one day exist only in zoos. People are trying to save the rain forests and woodlands where
the chimps live from being cut down. It will take many people working together to solve this problem.
_____________________2. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they kiss and make up. When one chimpanzee comforts another, it gives it a hug or
pat on the back. There are, of course, many ways that chimpanzees and humans are different. Chimpanzees are smaller and stronger than humans. An adult male chimpanzee stands three or four feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. But a
chimpanzee can lift more weight than a man who is six feet tall.
_____________________3. Chimps live in groups and like each other a lot, but sometimes they fight. Because they don’t want to stay angry at each other after a fight, they make up by holding a hand out to the other and kissing. They show
they are sorry with pats and hugs. Then the anger goes away.
_____________________4. A chimpanzee’s body is made for climbing and swinging in the trees. First, it uses its long arms to reach a branch. Next, with its flexible hands and feet, it grabs and hooks on to the branch. Finally, it swings from that branch to another branch of tree.
_____________________5. It is fun to read about chimpanzees. All wild chimpanzees live in Africa. They live mostly in thick rain forests and in woodlands. There are two types, or species, of chimpanzees—the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimpanzee.</h2><br />
