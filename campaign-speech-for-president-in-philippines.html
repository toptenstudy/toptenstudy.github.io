                                            How does it feel like to be someone running as the President of the Philippines? What will be the things that you wanted to say to the people of this country so that you can convince them to vote for you on election day? What will be your platforms that will become the basis in changing this country? In this activity, you will be writing you own campaign speech (of 200-300 words) as a running candidate for the President of the Philippines. It is very important that in composing your speech, an outline should be written first. After writing your outline, make the final revision of your speech.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much for inviting me to your wonderful state here in the great heartland of America but also pretty near the coast. It is an honor to speak from this podium, in this storied courthouse, where so many profound legal judgments were handed down that they more or less canceled each other out.</p><p>All subscriptions placed before March 1st will begin with Black Imagination After years of of popular demand from the clamoring masses, we are at last revamping and relaunching our McSweeney's...</p><p></p><p>I am a simple man with a Harvard degree and a solid understanding of tractors. When I was a young boy, my father took me on his knee and told me the principle that has guided my life ever since: “Agree with some things, disagree with other things.” His was truly the Greatest Generation, along with a few that came before and a couple that have come since.</p><p></p><p>Why am I running for president of the United States of America? That’s a good question, and perhaps there’s no good way to answer it. Or perhaps there is a good way to answer it. Either way, it’s a good question and I’m glad it was raised.</p><p></p><p>I want to talk a little bit about our nation’s children. Before this speech, a young man named Stanley Exley came up to me. Stanley is a mechanic, a noble profession if there ever was one. Or perhaps he is a chemistry professor, also noble. He was holding his small daughter, Emily, an adorable 3-year-old who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Stanley is a straight shooter, and he came up to me and asked me a question I’ll never forget: “Do you like children?” And I looked him straight in the eye and said, “Yes, Stanley, I very much like children.” Maybe that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s what I believe. And to those of you who would say, “I don’t think children are our future,” I must reply in the strongest of terms: “I disagree.” Sometimes you have to take a stand for what you believe in.</p><p></p><p>Our country is sharply divided over a war that is being waged in a distant land. My views on this war are clear: it is happening, it is happening in Iraq, and it will continue to happen until it stops. Some people believe we should withdraw all the troops now. Some people believe we should stay and fight until we’ve established a stable nation. Some people believe we should gradually hand over control to the Iraqi government. I feel blessed to live in a country with so many beliefs.</p><p>McSweeney's is ecstatic to announce that we've been nominated for the 2020 National Magazine Award for fiction. In celebration of this incredible news, we've put together a special bundle just for...</p><p></p><p>On the subject of South African apartheid: I strongly, strongly, strongly oppose it. I’m glad it’s gone, and I hope it never comes back.</p><p></p><p>The state of our economy is in flux. Every single day, the stock market goes up or goes down or stays the same. If elected president, I will ask the Federal Reserve to take a good long look at the interest rate and decide whether or not to change it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A commonality is that vocal music is of significant import to every ethnic group in the country. Although there are some music intended for dance, the best-preserved form of traditional music is that intended for the voice, with chanting epic poetry as having been the earliest form and later augmented by instrumental accompaniment. Regarded to have a wide range, as most of them stretch more than an octave, they are still considered within the capacity of even an average singer<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Sana makatulong ｡◕‿◕｡<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am not capable of creating visual materials such as campaign posters. However, I can suggest some platform ideas for a hypothetical campaign:</p><p></p>Education Reform - Increase funding for public education, improve the quality of education in public schools, and provide more opportunities for underprivileged students to access higher education.Job Creation - Create more job opportunities for Filipinos, especially in rural areas, by investing in infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship, and attracting foreign investors.Healthcare - Improve access to healthcare services for all Filipinos, especially those in remote areas, by increasing the number of healthcare facilities and healthcare workers, and implementing health programs that focus on prevention and early detection of diseases.Environmental Protection - Implement policies and programs that promote environmental sustainability and protect natural resources, including stricter regulations on mining and logging, and promoting the use of renewable energy.Anti-Corruption - Implement measures to curb corruption in government, including the creation of an independent anti-corruption agency and the strict enforcement of anti-corruption laws.Peace and Order - Improve law enforcement and strengthen the justice system to combat crime, terrorism, and other threats to the safety and security of Filipinos.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>These are just some platform ideas that can be used for a campaign poster. The poster should also include a clear and concise message that resonates with the people and inspires them to support the candidate.</p><br />

Stanley is a mechanic, a noble profession if there ever was one. Or perhaps he is a chemistry professor, also noble. He was holding his small daughter, Emily, an adorable 3-year-old who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Stanley is a straight shooter, and he came up to me and asked me a question I’ll never forget: “Do you like children?” And I looked him straight in the eye and said, “Yes, Stanley, I very much like children.” Maybe that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s what I believe. And to those of you who would say, “I don’t think children are our future,” I must reply in the strongest of terms: “I disagree.” Sometimes you have to take a stand for what you believe in.</p><p></p><p>Our country is sharply divided over a war that is being waged in a distant land. My views on this war are clear: it is happening, it is happening in Iraq, and it will continue to happen until it stops. Some people believe we should withdraw all the troops now. Some people believe we should stay and fight until we’ve established a stable nation. Some people believe we should gradually hand over control to the Iraqi government.

                        <p><strong>''My Presidential Campaign If I were The President''</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>     Leading a country is certainly a hard job. A leader must be responsible and aware about the problems rooted in our country. If I were to be the president, I will make sure that my administration and time as president will align with the values and advocacies that I hold dearly. My first advocacy will be reaching out to the poor. Poverty is one of the main problems we have in our country. If I were to be a president, I will address this issue with care, and understanding. Programs and projects will be implemented to help poor families to rise up back to their feet. Another problem that I would want to address is education. I believe that a proper education system will help our country and our fellow citizens to flourish and thrive. Proper education will also help in making the ideas and hopes of the young Filipino children to become true. Lastly, I want to give light to the environmental issues, we currently have in our country. I appreciate and love nature. Nature in our country should be thriving, so if I were to become president, I would make sure that our country will step into a more eco-conscious society. Those are my advocacies that I want to give importance to, if I were given the chance to lead our country.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>(There are a lot of advocacies that you could share in your own paragraph. The advocacies or platforms mentioned in the paragraph are my own opinions and advocacies. If you wish to change it, you may. This is simply your guide in making your own advocacy campaign.
