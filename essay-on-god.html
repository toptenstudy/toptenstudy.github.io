                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"Communion" is a good word. What do you think when you hear it? Maybe an ordinance of the church? Perhaps an archaic way saying relationship? Or even some mystical ambiguity connected to transcendence?</p><p></p><p>Communion is one of the few words in the English language that has a general meaning but maintains a sanctified use. "To speak a little of it in general," John Owen writes, "Communion relates to things and persons. A joint participation in any thing whatever, good or evil, duty or enjoyment, nature or actions. . . . (Works.II.7). In other words, communion most bascially is what's happening when we cheer on our favorite team with a group of friends.</p><p></p><p>But that's not the way we really use the word. We call those parties. And notwithstanding the joy aspect of parties, communion is about God — the one, true, personal God in three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit.</p><br />

                        <p>What is the relationship between God and morality?</p><p>
</p><p>God approves of right actions because they are right and disapproves of wrong actions because they are wrong (moral theological objectivism, or objectivism). So, morality is independent of God's will; however, since God is omniscient He knows the moral laws, and because He's moral, He follows them.</p><p></p><p>Does morality require God?</p><p>
</p><p>Therefore, all moral commands are the commands of a single, external agent. We are heavily influenced by moral commands and other commands of reason. ... Thus, the commands of morality (and the commands of reason more generally) require a god because they are, and can only be, the commands of one.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God first created the heavens and the earth. The abyss was covered in darkness, and the earth was formless and empty. And the sea's surface was being disturbed by the Holy Spirit of God. God then commanded the creation of light, which occurred. Creation must be used by humanity in a way that enhances rather than undermines its capacity to reveal God and to care for people and all living things on the planet today and in the future.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Relationship with god</p><p>             My relationship with God is based mainly on trust, love and respect, common values, time, and communication. Trust is a vital part the relationship between God and myself. I am frequently confiding in Him about personal issues that I prefer not to talk about with others. Talking to God about personal matters is not hard for me to do because secrecy is important to me and I am certain that I do not have to worry about someone else finding out.</p><p>             I trust and accept God and his beliefs, as well as the Bible. They are a considerable part of my life at home and at school. The Bible tells us to do what is right, and I trust that doing the right thing is the best thing for me to do. I have trust in God that He will guide me to do what is best.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it help</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prayer I believe that prayer is how we communicate with God. It is through prayer that we have intentional time to speak to him, not always out loud, but most often in our minds. Through prayer we communicate with God the hopes and desires of our heart. We thank him for what he has done and provided for us. We can also ask God for things through prayer, such as guidance or acceptance of certain situation</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>•̀ᴗ•̀</p><br />

                            8. essay about caring for the creation of god​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In Genesis the first humans are given responsibility for caring for creation, but despite this it hasn’t always been a strong theme of Christian thinking over the last 2000 years. Care for creation is even a latecomer to Catholic Social Teaching. Now the world’s resources grow scarcer, caring responsibly for creation is being considered more of a way to ensure respect for human dignity and peace than an end in itself.</p><p>Creation provides us with the physical fabric of our lives; the natural environment gives us the stuff we use every day. It gives us the food for our tables, the material for our clothes and the materials to build our houses and churches. It is also a place where people have experienced a great closeness with God through its beauty and wonder. Creation is a gift from God and provides us with these things, the basics for our lives, yet it can so easily and so often be taken for granted.</p><p>Modern technology has given us a huge amount of benefits that have helped alleviate suffering and create new methods of solidarity among people. At the same time we can also see how it has made it easier for us to become alienated from our environment, and it's given new and efficient ways to plunder the worlds natural resources en masse. Care for Creation ensures that we don’t neglect, but protect and respect the gift that is our natural environment.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps pls follow for more answers #CarryonLearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It says that God IS good. It's not just what he does; it's who he is — and who he is never changes. In Psalm 46, the psalmist says, “God is our refuge and strength, a present help in times of trouble. ... And THIS is why we can say with absolute confidence that God is good.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>GOODNESS OF GOD</p><p>Can we measure how good God is? </p><p>From the moment our life began until now He is already good. His mercy never fails us. Think of how many times we are so unfaithful and disobedient yet His goodness remains. No one can fathom His goodness. Eventhough how many times we fail He is always there for us to help us stand up again. As if no words can express how good He is .</p><p></p><br />

He lets chart my own course in life and trusts that I will do what is right and follow his beliefs and teachings.</p><p>             The love and respect I have for God, as well as His for me, helps build a better relationship. I show my love for god by making sacrifices. I am often sacrificing time to help my sibling witch homework, or being patient with my parents when they are busy. I also make the occasional large sacrifice such as giving part of my annual allowance to a charity. These things are done to show my love for God.</p><p>             I also show my love for God by treating others kindly and with respect. I will lend a helping hand to someone in need, or make someone feel better if they are in need of cheering up. When I see someone I am always making an effort to say hello or smile at him or her as they pass by. At all times I am reminding myself to say please and thank you to show my appreciation.</p><br />

                            14. essay: why god's love constant?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God's love is constant because it is not based on external factors or conditions. Unlike human love, which can be fleeting and conditional, God's love is unconditional and enduring. It is not influenced by circumstances or the actions of individuals, but rather is rooted in God's very nature as a loving and compassionate being.</p><p></p><p>God's love is eternal and infinite, and is expressed in various ways throughout the Bible. One of the most well-known verses about God's love is found in John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse illustrates the depth of God's love for humanity and his willingness to sacrifice his own son for the sake of our salvation.</p><p></p><p>Another example of God's constant love can be found in the book of Psalms, where the psalmist writes, "But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" (Psalm 86:15). This verse highlights the fact that God's love is not fleeting or temporary, but rather is a fundamental aspect of his character.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, God's love is not limited to a select group of people, but is extended to all of humanity. As the apostle Paul writes in Romans 5:8, "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." This verse shows that God's love is not dependent on our actions or our worthiness, but is freely given to us, even when we are undeserving.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, God's love is constant because it is not influenced by external factors or conditions, but is rooted in God's very nature as a loving and compassionate being. It is an enduring love that is expressed in various ways throughout the Bible and is extended to all of humanity, regardless of our actions or our worthiness. As we reflect on God's constant love, may we be inspired to love others with the same kind of unconditional and enduring love.</p><p></p><br />

                            15. Prove the eternality of God (essay) ​</h2><br />
                        The existence of God is foundational to the study of theology. The Bible does not seek to prove God’s existence, but rather takes it for granted. Scripture expresses a strong doctrine of natural revelation: the existence and attributes of God are evident from the creation itself, even though sinful human beings suppress and distort their natural knowledge of God. The dominant question in the Old and New Testaments is not whether God is, but rather who God is. Philosophers both Christian and non-Christian have offered a wide range of arguments for God’s existence, and the discipline of natural theology (what can be known or proven about God from nature alone) is flourishing today. Some philosophers, however, have proposed that belief in God is rationally justified even without theistic arguments or evidences. Meanwhile, professing atheists have offered arguments against God’s existence; the most popular is the argument from evil, which contends that the existence and extent of evil in the world gives us good reason not to believe in God. In response, Christian thinkers have developed various theodicies, which seek to explain why God is morally justified in permitting the evils we observe.
<p>
</p>If theology is the study of God and his works, then the existence of God is as foundational to theology as the existence of rocks is to geology. Two basic questions have been raised regarding belief in God’s existence: (1) Is it true? (2) Is it rationally justified (and if so, on what grounds)? The second is distinct from the first because a belief can be true without being rationally justified (e.g., someone might irrationally believe that he’ll die on a Thursday, a belief that turns out by chance to be true). Philosophers have grappled with both questions for millennia. In this essay, we will consider what the Bible says in answer to these questions, before sampling the answers of some influential Christian<p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Parents are often seen as a gift of God, as they are the ones who bring us into this world, nurture us, and help us grow into the individuals we are meant to be. They are a source of love, guidance, and support, and they help shape our character and values.</p><p></p><p>As we grow older, we come to appreciate the sacrifices and hard work our parents have put into raising us. They have provided us with food, shelter, and clothing, and have given us the opportunity to receive an education and pursue our dreams. They have also taught us important life lessons, such as the value of hard work, honesty, and respect for others.</p><p></p><p>In many religious traditions, parents are seen as a gift from God, as they are the ones who pass down their faith and values to their children. They are seen as the first teachers of the faith, and are responsible for instilling a love of God and a sense of morality in their children.</p><p></p><p>It is important to recognize the gift of parents, and to show them love, respect, and appreciation for all that they have done for us. We can do this by spending time with them, expressing gratitude for their hard work and sacrifices, and living our lives in a way that honors the values and lessons they have taught us.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, parents are often seen as a gift of God, as they provide us with love, guidance, and support throughout our lives. They help shape our character and values, and are responsible for passing down important life lessons and faith traditions. We should recognize the gift of parents and show them love, respect, and appreciation for all that they have done for us.</p><p><strong>  We normally hear the saying that we all are brothers and sisters as we are all God's children. If we are the children of God, then our parents can be considered to be the best gift that God could provide us.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The reason for this is that what we are today can be said to be because of our parents. Our behavior and culture are all thought to us by our parents. They help us to take the first step of our life. They are with us all the time. They teach us the difference between right and wrong, between good behavior and bad behavior along with many other things.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>They teach us many things with patience and kindness and without our parents, we will not be there where we are today.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Gods love and the bible how strong is it and is it expressed deeply in the Bible? To me there aren't better words to say how deep of love that God has for himself and others. He gave us a child of his to die on the cross for our sins; anyone who would do this in my eyes has unconditional love for others. Throughout the Bible it is to be said numerous of times how God's love in Godly and unconditional.</p><p>             We are taught that love one another, for our love comes from God himself. If you have love then you know God and them who don't have love doesn't know God. Even though we have never seen God with our eyes, in our hearts we will see him by loving one another. Our love should be whole for the love he has for us is whole. In 1 Corinthians 13, Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. This is true when God created heavens and earth. If the love wasn't strong when it came time for the heavens and earth to be created he could of created a earth that was unholy and nothing but evil, but in this process Love was the main focus that God used.</p><p>             In the creation of man nothing was used, but the holy Love from God. When God came to earth and seen that the rain he sent needed man to care for the earth, he created man from the dust of the earth that the man would be working. After this process God seen that man needed a partner, that it wasn't good for man to be alone so he started by giving livestock and then he looked and seen that this wasn't it, and said that this wasn't a suitable helper. So it was that the man would fall into a deep sleep, and from the rib of the man he created what he would call women, and brought her to the man. They would live as husband and wife, and would learn to love one another through time. Creating a man then from him a women show how God's unconditional love was for the creation</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nasa ggle yan.</p><br />

                        <p>Faith is like a check. All you have to do is hold on to the check, go to the bank to present it and you can confidently expect the money to appear in your account after a certain time. If you throw the check away the money will not be put in your account. God is trustworthy and always has resources to back his promises.</p><p></p><p>Living faith always has corresponding actions. We talk what we really believe, and we act according to what we really believe. The heroes of faith like Abraham were considered men of faith because they acted on what God showed them. They acted on their faith. (Hebrews 11:17-38, James 2:21-23).</p><p></p><p>To live in faith means to do and say what you believe is right, without doubting.</p><p></p><p>Faith is a rest. It is compatible with inner peace. It is not “trying to believe”. To say that you are “trying to believe” God is to say that you don’t believe Him. The man who is “trying to believe” may be sincere, but he does not have faith in that area yet.</p><p></p><p>Those who don’t believe God inevitably believe in something else. Either religious tradition, or their understanding of science, or what the women’s magazine says, or what their next door neighbor tells them, the education system, the mass-media or a combination of all these things. God is not impressed. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” (Romans 1:22) In fact, those who don’t fully believing God end up believing the devil somewhere along the track. It is very possible to believe what the devil says without even believing that he exists! Satan is speaking through so many philosophies and religions without openly declaring himself. Not too many actually know they are trusting the words of Satan and his demons.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlist po:)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>because he is our almighty father in heaven, he is our savior ,our strength. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In all things, God is our loving Father. He begat us, is nurturing us through the Holy Spirit, and is preparing us for our ultimate purpose. </p><p></p><p>We may sin, we may turn away, but God will never forsake us. He will always be there, loving us through everything we do. In much of modern Christianity, God is addressed as the Father, in part because of his active interest in human affairs, in the way that a father would take an interest in his children who are dependent on him and as a father, he will respond to humanity, his children, acting in their best interests.</p><p> “We love God because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). God is the first cause of all that is good and right in the world. Wherever and whenever love exists on earth, it only exists because it is a reflection of God's perfect love that created us and sustains us.</p><p></p><p>Psalm 103:13: "The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him." Proverbs 3:11-12: "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
