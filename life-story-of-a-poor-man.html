There was a successful businessman who came from a low-income family. Yet despite being poor, he studied hard. 
His father was a construction worker, and his mother was a laundrywoman. He resolved to work while studying at the same time.
With the passing of years and perseverance, he finally graduated, and his life continued to change and flourish. 
Eventually, the young man got married and had children. Everything that his children needed was provided for in an instant.
He vowed that his children would never let his children experience the hardship he went through.
Instead of living a good life, the children became rebellious. They did not go to school and complained about the slightest difficulty and challenge in life.
What advice can you give to the father to correct his mistake?</a>

                                            can someone answer this?The Story of ZacchaeusOne day Jesus traveled through a town named Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1. Who was Zacchaeus?2. Why didn’t people like him?3. How did Jesus treat Zacchaeus?4. How did Zacchaeus change after meeting Jesus?5. Why is honesty important in our relationships with other people?​</a>

He had a luxurious life. He always boasted about his wealth to his friends and relatives. His son was studying in a distant city and he returned home for vacation. The rich man wanted to show off to his son how rich he was. But his son wasn't fond of any luxurious lifestyle. However, the rich man wanted to make his son realize that his lifestyle was extremely rich and that poor people suffered a lot. He planned a day's visit to the entire town to show him the life of the poor people. The father and the son took a chariot and visited the entire town. They returned home after two days. The father was happy that his son was very quiet after seeing the poor I understandpeople honoring the rich man and after witnessing the sufferings of the poor due to lack of facilities. The rich man asked his son, "Dear boy, how was the trip? Have you enjoyed it?" "Yes, my dad, it was a great trip with you," the son replied. "So, what did you learn from the trip?" the father asked. The son was silent. "Finally, you have realized how the poor suffer and how they actually live," said the father. "No father," replied the son. He added, "We have only two dogs, they have 10 dogs. We have a big pool in our garden, but they have a massive bay without any end! We have luxurious and expensive lights imported from various countries, but they have countless stars lighting their nights. We have a house on a small piece of land, but they have abundant fields that go beyond the horizon. We are protected by huge and strong walls around our property, but they bond with each other and surround themselves with their fellow beings. We have to buy food from them, but they are so rich that they can cultivate their own food." The rich father was stunned and speechless on hearing his son's words. Finally, the son added, "Dad, thank you so much for showing me who is rich and who is poor.​</a>

                                            Read the story and answer the following questions. A young student, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to 1.

                                            How to Hunt a Monkey (Inspirational Short Story about Letting Go) "Do you know how hunters of old used to trap monkeys?" A man asked his child. "Rather than chasing them up a tree or shooting arrows from below, they'd put a heavy glass jar with a narrow neck on the floor, which had the monkeys' favorite food inside. They'd then step back and hide, waiting for the unsuspecting animal to approach When it did, the monkey would reach inside, clench a fist around the food, and try to pull it out. However, the narrow neck of the jar would stop the poor monkey from getting its hand out! It'd pull and pull, but to no avail. There was simply no way to get its hand out of the jar without releasing the food. Rather than letting go, though, the monkey would persevere, refusing to drop its dinner. The hunters would then approach and catch it to enjoy a meal of their own." "Don't be like that monkey," warned the man, "In life, to fight another day and grow as person, you must know when to quit, when to move on, and when to let go of whatever's holding you back." ano ang natutunan sa kuwento:​</a>

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.

"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,

straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking

make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado

8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.

unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

Shiro and the Gold
Long ago in Japan, there lived an old couple who had a dog named Shiro. The man
and the woman were poor and they lived a simple life. All they wanted was enough money to
buy rice for themselves and Shiro. But year after year, their savings grew smaller. They
worried that soon there would be no money for rice.
One day, the couple were working hard in their garden. Shiro ran here and there,
sniffing the ground. Suddenly, he started barking loudly while digging a hole.
“Be quite, Shiro,” said the old woman.
But Shiro kept barking and digging, so the old man went to see what the dog had
found. So he poked a stick into the hole and felt it strike something hard. He dug a little
further and discovered a small box. When the old man opened the box, he was amazed to
see it was full of gold coins- enough to buy rice for the rest of the year!
But their greedy neighbor heard of their good fortune and became envious. He
followed Shiro, digging holes wherever the dog sniffed, but found nothing. Finally, the
neighbor became very angry and killed poor Shiro.
The old couple cried when they learned that Shiro was dead. They loved the old dog
very much. Then one night, Shiro’s ghost appeared to them.
“You loved and cared for me”, said Shiro’s ghost, “and now I shall care for you.
Tomorrow cut down the pine tree in the garden. Mix some splinters from the tree into a pot of
rice”. Then the ghost vanished.
The next day, the old man cut down the pine tree and the old woman cooked a pot of
rice. She stirred in the splinters and peered into the pot.
“Look!” she cried, her eyes filled with wonder. “Each grain of rice is turning into a gold
coin! We shall have money to buy rice for the rest of our lives!”
The old couple smiled sadly as they thought of Shiro. Even though he had died, their
faithful dog had not forgotten them.

Huang Fu and the Bottle of Wine Huang Fu was a very rich man yet was deliberately tough on his farmhand, Hop. Huang Fu gave Hop a bottle and said, “Buy me a bottle of wine.” Hop, the poor farmhand enquired, “How can I buy you wine with no money at all?” Huang Fu replied disdainfully, “Anyone can buy wine with money. It takes real
skill to buy wine without money.” Time elapsed then Hop eventually returned. He returned with the empty bottle. Similarly, he handed the bottle to Huang Fu and murmured, “Enjoy the wine, please.” Because the bottle was still empty, Huang asked in dismay, “There is no wine, how can I enjoy this?” Hop replied with a straight face, “Anyone can enjoy wine if there is some. It takes a real skill to enjoy wine when there is none.” Huang Fu made a choking sound but was unable to utter a word.

A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

Zacchaeus heard that Jesus was coming to visit Jericho, and wanted to see him.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Jesus looked up and said, “Hurry down, Zacchaeus, because I must stay in your house today.” The people started grumbling because Jesus was going to the home of a sinner. However, Zacchaeus promised to give half his belongings to the poor and pay back four times as much to anyone he had cheated.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus showed he was willing to change by offering half of his belongings to the poor and paying back four times as much to anyone he had cheated.

When you're always honest with someone, it tells them that they can trust you and the things you say.

However, the rich man wanted to make his son realize that his lifestyle was extremely rich and that poor people suffered a lot. He planned a day's visit to the entire town to show him the life of the poor people. The father and the son took a chariot and visited the entire town. They returned home after two days. The father was happy that his son was very quiet after seeing the poor I understandpeople honoring the rich man and after witnessing the sufferings of the poor due to lack of facilities. The rich man asked his son, "Dear boy, how was the trip? Have you enjoyed it?" "Yes, my dad, it was a great trip with you," the son replied. "So, what did you learn from the trip?" the father asked. The son was silent. "Finally, you have realized how the poor suffer and how they actually live," said the father. "No father," replied the son. He added, "We have only two dogs, they have 10 dogs. We have a big pool in our garden, but they have a massive bay without any end! We have luxurious and expensive lights imported from various countries, but they have countless stars lighting their nights. We have a house on a small piece of land, but they have abundant fields that go beyond the horizon. We are protected by huge and strong walls around our property, but they bond with each other and surround themselves with their fellow beings. We have to buy food from them, but they are so rich that they can cultivate their own food." The rich father was stunned and speechless on hearing his son's words.

                            13. Read the story and answer the following questions. A young student, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. After reading the story, I have come to the conclusion that it is about the <strong>joy of giving</strong>. The young boy first wanted to play a mean trick on the poor farmer, but the teacher stopped him. Instead, the teacher asked him to do something nice for the stranger and watch what was going to happen.</p><p>2. The story has <strong>moved </strong>me. I understand how the boy felt. It has made me feel <strong>more willing to do kind things </strong>for other people. Likewise, I can better appreciate all the acts of kindness that I have experienced in my life.  </p><p>3. If I were in the shoes of the farmer, I would also <strong>feel shocked and grateful</strong>. Life has clearly not been good to the poor man, who had to work under the heat of the sun to support his loved ones. When you are feeling down, a little help can go a long way. It is also moving to know that there are <strong>people who care about me </strong>even if we do not know each other.</p><p>4. The author is trying to say that when you are in the position to help other people, you should not hesitate to do so. <strong>This is not only for the person but also for your own sake</strong>. By helping other people, you will get more joy from knowing that you have done some good in the world.</p><p>5. The short story wanted to show that <strong>we should help people who are less fortunate </strong>than we are. An act of kindness will always be better than a mean joke. It is good to spread love and kindness whenever you can. The two coins might have been nothing to the rich boy, but it made such a big difference to the poor man.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p><p>I agree with the author. There is no joy in making fun of people who are already feeling down. It might be funny to you, but it will make things so much more difficult for them. Instead, we should all focus our attention and energy into helping others. <strong>Every act of kindness goes a long way</strong>. In both small and big ways, there are always things we can do to make life at least a bit better and easier for others. The joy we get from these actions is always going to be more satisfying than the laughs we get from mean pranks.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is the definition of a short story: https://brainly.ph/question/10282148</p><br />

                            14. How to Hunt a Monkey (Inspirational Short Story about Letting Go) "Do you know how hunters of old used to trap monkeys?" A man asked his child. "Rather than chasing them up a tree or shooting arrows from below, they'd put a heavy glass jar with a narrow neck on the floor, which had the monkeys' favorite food inside. They'd then step back and hide, waiting for the unsuspecting animal to approach When it did, the monkey would reach inside, clench a fist around the food, and try to pull it out. However, the narrow neck of the jar would stop the poor monkey from getting its hand out! It'd pull and pull, but to no avail. There was simply no way to get its hand out of the jar without releasing the food. Rather than letting go, though, the monkey would persevere, refusing to drop its dinner. The hunters would then approach and catch it to enjoy a meal of their own." "Don't be like that monkey," warned the man, "In life, to fight another day and grow as person, you must know when to quit, when to move on, and when to let go of whatever's holding you back." ano ang natutunan sa kuwento:​</h2><br />

The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to   1.

2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.

8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.

The rich man wanted to show off to his son how rich he was. But his son wasn't fond of any luxurious lifestyle.

He planned a day's visit to the entire town to show him the life of the poor people. The father and the son took a chariot and visited the entire town. They returned home after two days. The father was happy that his son was very quiet after seeing the poor I understandpeople honoring the rich man and after witnessing the sufferings of the poor due to lack of facilities. The rich man asked his son, "Dear boy, how was the trip? Have you enjoyed it?" "Yes, my dad, it was a great trip with you," the son replied. "So, what did you learn from the trip?" the father asked. The son was silent. "Finally, you have realized how the poor suffer and how they actually live," said the father. "No father," replied the son. He added, "We have only two dogs, they have 10 dogs. We have a big pool in our garden, but they have a massive bay without any end! We have luxurious and expensive lights imported from various countries, but they have countless stars lighting their nights. We have a house on a small piece of land, but they have abundant fields that go beyond the horizon. We are protected by huge and strong walls around our property, but they bond with each other and surround themselves with their fellow beings. We have to buy food from them, but they are so rich that they can cultivate their own food." The rich father was stunned and speechless on hearing his son's words. Finally, the son added, "Dad, thank you so much for showing me who is rich and who is poor.​</h2><br />

                            20. what was the rich man thinking while looking at a members of the poor family?here's the storySummary of the story just in case:On the Island of Luzon, There was a Happy family who always enjoyed the day every day. The children were always playing outside with a smile, bathing in a cold river from mountains, full of enjoyment. Until one day, there was a Sad family who came home in their house. They always locked the windows tightly that no sunlight enters.The children were curious about that house because they looked up in the window, pale and thin children looking to their place. The children were always watching the other children, playing outside with the sun shines. The rich man always locked the windows and closed all curtains. The rich man’s servants were cooking special foods that the happy children smelt the aroma. They always stay in the window to smell the spirit of the food. They sing, play, swim. Sometimes, they laugh out loud then the other neighbor joins them and laugh at them.Until the day came that the rich man filed a case to the Father that he always stealing the spirits of his food and wealth. Though, they end up in court, with their family. They wait for the jury to judge them. The father had no attorney but the rich man had. The father always agrees to all questions they always smell the aroma of their food, but not wealth. Father told the rich man to see his children, and they came, pale and thin.After that, The father stood up and get some coins for his children and wife and put them in his straw hat. Then, he walked to the rich man and sounded the coins and then he said to him if he heard the spirit of the sound, then the rich man agrees and he fell. The Jury stopped the case and congratulated the father and he wants to hear his children laugh. They laugh out loud but the jury laughed harder.ORIn this story, The Family of the father was happy all the time, they don’t need wealth, they need love and sacrifice that connect them. They play a good role in their life without wealth. They always have positive minds and looks that they don’t depend on what they see. They aren’t materialistic. They always end up with a smile. Plays peacefully.On the other side, They depend on what they see. Meaning, they judge the other side with their wealth and spirit. Sad and pale. They are materialistic, not that much but they always end up with a negative look to the other side and accused them of stealing their spirit.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>based on the context of the story, it can be inferred that the rich man may have felt superior and looked down upon the poor family. He may have also felt threatened by them, especially when he accused them of stealing the "spirit" of his food and wealth. It is possible that the rich man was driven by his greed for material possessions and saw the poor family as a potential threat to his wealth and status.</strong></p><p></p><br />

Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again.

Two women passed. One said to the other “Look at that selfish old fellow, riding while his little son follows on foot!” The man then took the boy up behind him. The next traveler they met asked the man, “Is the donkey yours?” “Yes, it’s ours.” The man said, “No one would think so from the way you use it. Why, you are better able to carry the donkey than it is to carry both of you.” So, the man tied the donkey’s legs to a pole. Staggering under the weights, they carried it into town. There, they were greeted with much laughter. The man got angry and threw the donkey into the river. Seizing his son by the arm, they set off home.Read and write the letter of your answer as to the mood, tone and purpose suggested by the expression.11.

He had a luxurious life. He always boasted about his wealth to his friends and relatives. His son was studying in a distant city and he returned home for vacation. The rich man wanted to show off to his son how rich he was. But his son wasn't fond of any luxurious lifestyle. However, the rich man wanted to make his son realize that his lifestyle was extremely rich and that poor people suffered a lot. He planned a day's visit to the entire town to show him the life of the poor people. The father and the son took a chariot and visited the entire town. They returned home after two days. The father was happy that his son was very quiet after seeing the poor I understandpeople honoring the rich man and after witnessing the sufferings of the poor due to lack of facilities. The rich man asked his son, "Dear boy, how was the trip? Have you enjoyed it?" "Yes, my dad, it was a great trip with you," the son replied. "So, what did you learn from the trip?" the father asked. The son was silent. "Finally, you have realized how the poor suffer and how they actually live," said the father. "No father," replied the son. He added, "We have only two dogs, they have 10 dogs. We have a big pool in our garden, but they have a massive bay without any end! We have luxurious and expensive lights imported from various countries, but they have countless stars lighting their nights. We have a house on a small piece of land, but they have abundant fields that go beyond the horizon. We are protected by huge and strong walls around our property, but they bond with each other and surround themselves with their fellow beings. We have to buy food from them, but they are so rich that they can cultivate their own food." The rich father was stunned and speechless on hearing his son's words. Finally, the son added, "Dad, thank you so much for showing me who is rich and who is poor.​</h2><br />

Shiro and the Gold
Long ago in Japan, there lived an old couple who had a dog named Shiro. The man
and the woman were poor and they lived a simple life. All they wanted was enough money to
buy rice for themselves and Shiro. But year after year, their savings grew smaller. They
worried that soon there would be no money for rice.
One day, the couple were working hard in their garden. Shiro ran here and there,
sniffing the ground. Suddenly, he started barking loudly while digging a hole.
“Be quite, Shiro,” said the old woman.
But Shiro kept barking and digging, so the old man went to see what the dog had
found. So he poked a stick into the hole and felt it strike something hard. He dug a little
further and discovered a small box. When the old man opened the box, he was amazed to
see it was full of gold coins- enough to buy rice for the rest of the year!
But their greedy neighbor heard of their good fortune and became envious. He
followed Shiro, digging holes wherever the dog sniffed, but found nothing. Finally, the
neighbor became very angry and killed poor Shiro.
The old couple cried when they learned that Shiro was dead. They loved the old dog
very much. Then one night, Shiro’s ghost appeared to them.
“You loved and cared for me”, said Shiro’s ghost, “and now I shall care for you.
Tomorrow cut down the pine tree in the garden. Mix some splinters from the tree into a pot of
rice”. Then the ghost vanished.
The next day, the old man cut down the pine tree and the old woman cooked a pot of
rice. She stirred in the splinters and peered into the pot.
“Look!” she cried, her eyes filled with wonder. “Each grain of rice is turning into a gold
coin! We shall have money to buy rice for the rest of our lives!”
The old couple smiled sadly as they thought of Shiro. Even though he had died, their
faithful dog had not forgotten them.

Huang Fu and the Bottle of Wine Huang Fu was a very rich man yet was deliberately tough on his farmhand, Hop. Huang Fu gave Hop a bottle and said, “Buy me a bottle of wine.” Hop, the poor farmhand enquired, “How can I buy you wine with no money at all?” Huang Fu replied disdainfully, “Anyone can buy wine with money. It takes real
skill to buy wine without money.” Time elapsed then Hop eventually returned. He returned with the empty bottle. Similarly, he handed the bottle to Huang Fu and murmured, “Enjoy the wine, please.” Because the bottle was still empty, Huang asked in dismay, “There is no wine, how can I enjoy this?” Hop replied with a straight face, “Anyone can enjoy wine if there is some. It takes a real skill to enjoy wine when there is none.” Huang Fu made a choking sound but was unable to utter a word.
