There are several research studies that have been conducted in this area, including the development and validation of an Academic Self-efficacy Scale for Filipino junior high school students, curriculum negotiation in Filipino language classrooms with diverse linguistic starting points, and emerging perceptions and perspectives of Filipino American middle school students. Additionally, there is a growing movement towards mother tongue-based multilingual education in the Philippines, which supports the use of local languages as the primary languages of instruction at the secondary level.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong> </strong><strong>maka</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ge</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliests</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>k</strong><strong> </strong><strong>y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The issue of gender equality in employment has given rise to numerous policies in advanced industrial countries, all aimed at tackling gender discrimination regarding recruitment, salary and promotion. Yet gender inequalities in the workplace persist. The purpose of this research is to document the psychosocial process involved in the persistence of gender discrimination against working women. Drawing on the literature on the justification of discrimination, we hypothesized that the myths according to which women’s work threatens children and family life mediates the relationship between sexism and opposition to a mother’s career. We tested this hypothesis using the Family and Changing Gender Roles module of the International Social Survey Programme. The dataset contained data collected in 1994 and 2012 from 51632 respondents from 18 countries. Structural equation modellings confirmed the hypothesised mediation. Overall, the findings shed light on how motherhood myths justify the gender structure in countries promoting gender equality.</p><br />

                        <strong>WHY IS IT THAT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO STUDY THE LIFE OF NATIONAL HEROES THAN THAT OF LOCAL HEROES?</strong><p><strong>Because national heroes are well recognized on a national level, which implies that they are known by the whole country, their lives are much easier to study than those of local heroes. </strong>Local <strong>heroes,</strong> on the other hand, are only known at the local level, that is, in specific locations such as municipal and provincial levels. Because the achievements of national <strong>heroes</strong> are well-known, it is common for local heroes' efforts to go unnoticed or unnoticed by those who live near them.</p><p>Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Aguinaldo, Apolinario Mabini, and Marcelo H. Del Pilar are among the<strong> national heroes</strong>. Teachers, doctors, other front-line medical health workers, police officers, and other public officials, on the other hand, might be characterized as <strong>local heroes.</strong> They may not be well-known on their own, but their cumulative actions can be attributed to them as a<strong> "hero."</strong></p><p>A <strong>hero</strong> is a person who has had a positive impact on the Philippines and is admired and recognized for their bravery, amazing achievements, and noble traits. A person who symbolizes all of us and has made substantial positive contributions to society's growth and development is known as a <strong>national hero.</strong> Knowing our <strong>heroes</strong> is to know ourselves: our beliefs, our collective history, who we are as Filipinos, and what makes us so wonderful as a nation and as individuals. Recognizing our <strong>heroes </strong>is a reflection of who we are as a people, as well as our culture, tradition, and history.</p><p></p><p>Who is your hero or heroes? ​|brainly.ph/question/13412039</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
