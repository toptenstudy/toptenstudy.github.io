                                            Q3M1 AND 2: DESCRIBING MOTION MEL'CS: Describe the motion of an object in terms of distance or displacement, speed or velocity or acceleration. SUMMARY: Motion is defined as the change in position over an interval of time. Acceleration refers to the rate of change in speed or velocity of an object. Deceleration is when an object is at rest or zero. Average speed represents the speed of the object throughout travel. It is obtained by dividing the total distance by the total time elapsed. Average velocity represent the velocity of the object throughout it’s travel. It is obtained by dividing the total displacement by the total time elapsed. Displacement refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like distance between its point of origin and its point of destination. It is indicated by direction. Distance refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Reference point is zero location in a coordinate system or frame of reference. Uniform motion happens when instantaneous speed values are always the same which means that the object is moving with constant speed. Speed refers to the rate of change in distance. Velocity refers to the rate of change in displacement. Also known as speed with direction. Motion can be describe through visuals by using diagrams, graphs. Instructions: Read and follow instructions. Write in a sheet of coupon bond, take picture send it through my messenger or lms moodle. WRITTEN OUTPUT: Describe or define the following terms. Use the above literature. Motion, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, reference point, instantaneous speed, uniform motion. PERFORMANCE OUTPUT: Draw your house-school road map using this scale 1cm=1km . Make sure that you will include land marks, name of road, establishments as you pass by. You can use ruler to do your road map. bold lines (distance long- cut), broken lines (displacement short- cut), land marks with visual representations. .

Best of Luck! 1. Movement is evident all around us. 2. Tiny molecules, atoms and electrons move in motion. 3. There are three ways where we can describe the position of the objects. 4. Motion can be described through visual, diagrams, and time graph. 5. Motion is simply defined in Science as a change in position for a particular time interval. 6. Motion is relative to the observer's point of reference. 7. We can express the change in position by using distance and displacement 8. Displacement is a vector quantity having both magnitude and direction. 9. Speed is defined as the distance travelled divided by the time of travel. 10. Units like kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mi/h), and meters per second (m/s) can be used to express speed. 11. We use the term velocity to describe the speed with direction. 12. Instantaneous speed is the speed at a given instant. 13. Constant motion is seen when there is no change in the instantaneous speed of the object. 14. All things here on Earth are moving with reference to the sun because the earth is rotating around the sun. 15. Motorcycle is moving at a velocity of 60km/h. After 30 minutes it slows down and completely stops. The motorcycle's acceleration is negative.​</a>

SUMMARY: Motion is defined as the change in position over an interval of time. Acceleration refers to the rate of change in speed or velocity of an object. Deceleration is when an object is at rest or zero. Average speed represents the speed of the object throughout travel. It is obtained by dividing the total distance by the total time elapsed. Average velocity represent the velocity of the object throughout it’s travel. It is obtained by dividing the total displacement by the total time elapsed. Displacement refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like distance between its point of origin and its point of destination. It is indicated by direction. Distance refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Reference point is zero location in a coordinate system or frame of reference. Uniform motion happens when instantaneous speed values are always the same which means that the object is moving with constant speed. Speed refers to the rate of change in distance. Velocity refers to the rate of change in displacement. Also known as speed with direction. Motion can be describe through visuals by using diagrams, graphs. Instructions: Read and follow instructions. Write in a sheet of coupon bond, take picture send it through my messenger or lms moodle. WRITTEN OUTPUT: Describe or define the following terms. Use the above literature. Motion, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, reference point, instantaneous speed, uniform motion.

                            7. Q3M1 AND 2: DESCRIBING MOTION MEL'CS: Describe the motion of an object in terms of distance or displacement, speed or velocity or acceleration. SUMMARY: Motion is defined as the change in position over an interval of time. Acceleration refers to the rate of change in speed or velocity of an object. Deceleration is when an object is at rest or zero. Average speed represents the speed of the object throughout travel. It is obtained by dividing the total distance by the total time elapsed. Average velocity represent the velocity of the object throughout it’s travel. It is obtained by dividing the total displacement by the total time elapsed. Displacement refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like distance between its point of origin and its point of destination. It is indicated by direction. Distance refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Reference point is zero location in a coordinate system or frame of reference. Uniform motion happens when instantaneous speed values are always the same which means that the object is moving with constant speed. Speed refers to the rate of change in distance. Velocity refers to the rate of change in displacement. Also known as speed with direction. Motion can be describe through visuals by using diagrams, graphs. Instructions: Read and follow instructions. Write in a sheet of coupon bond, take picture send it through my messenger or lms moodle. WRITTEN OUTPUT: Describe or define the following terms. Use the above literature. Motion, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, reference point, instantaneous speed, uniform motion. PERFORMANCE OUTPUT: Draw your house-school road map using this scale 1cm=1km . Make sure that you will include land marks, name of road, establishments as you pass by. You can use ruler to do your road map. bold lines (distance long- cut), broken lines (displacement short- cut), land marks with visual representations. .

Movement is evident all around us. 2. Tiny molecules, atoms and electrons move in motion. 3. There are three ways where we can describe the position of the objects. 4. Motion can be described through visual, diagrams, and time graph. 5. Motion is simply defined in Science as a change in position for a particular time interval. 6. Motion is relative to the observer's point of reference. 7. We can express the change in position by using distance and displacement 8. Displacement is a vector quantity having both magnitude and direction. 9. Speed is defined as the distance travelled divided by the time of travel. 10. Units like kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mi/h), and meters per second (m/s) can be used to express speed. 11. We use the term velocity to describe the speed with direction. 12. Instantaneous speed is the speed at a given instant. 13. Constant motion is seen when there is no change in the instantaneous speed of the object. 14. All things here on Earth are moving with reference to the sun because the earth is rotating around the sun. 15. Motorcycle is moving at a velocity of 60km/h. After 30 minutes it slows down and completely stops. The motorcycle's acceleration is negative.​</h2><br />

                            17. Q3M1 AND 2: DESCRIBING MOTION MEL'CS: Describe the motion of an object in terms of distance or displacement, speed or velocity or acceleration. SUMMARY: Motion is defined as the change in position over an interval of time. Acceleration refers to the rate of change in speed or velocity of an object. Deceleration is when an object is at rest or zero. Average speed represents the speed of the object throughout travel. It is obtained by dividing the total distance by the total time elapsed. Average velocity represent the velocity of the object throughout it’s travel. It is obtained by dividing the total displacement by the total time elapsed. Displacement refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like distance between its point of origin and its point of destination. It is indicated by direction. Distance refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of the object at a particular instant. Reference point is zero location in a coordinate system or frame of reference. Uniform motion happens when instantaneous speed values are always the same which means that the object is moving with constant speed. Speed refers to the rate of change in distance. Velocity refers to the rate of change in displacement. Also known as speed with direction. Motion can be describe through visuals by using diagrams, graphs. Instructions: Read and follow instructions. Write in a sheet of coupon bond, take picture send it through my messenger or lms moodle. WRITTEN OUTPUT: Describe or define the following terms. Use the above literature. Motion, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, reference point, instantaneous speed, uniform motion. PERFORMANCE OUTPUT: Draw your house-school road map using this scale 1cm=1km . Make sure that you will include land marks, name of road, establishments as you pass by. You can use ruler to do your road map. bold lines (distance long- cut), broken lines (displacement short- cut), land marks with visual representations. .
