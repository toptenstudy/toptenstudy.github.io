                        <p>Dear Mother Earth,</p><p>I may be a young teenager who doesn't know what I will be, but you know how I've grown by just watching me. I know that life without you is living in peril because you are the only reason why I am living. You are a gift from God and yet, no one cares about you especially this time that modernization eats you. I hate to admit it but you are the true victim and I know I can do something yet I can't stand by my own feet. Dear Mother Earth, please forgive me. I know that I am wrong, but I'm afraid to correct. Surely this time, I'll have my own shine. I promise to keep you existing until my last generation's final breath.</p><br />

                            20. The world has becoming chaotic. There are so many things happening around the world – war, epidemic, famine, drugs. It’s time to show mother earth we care by making a compassionate letter for her.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For thousands of years, various spiritual traditions and social activists have appealed to humans to adopt compassionate ways of living to address the suffering of life. Yet, along with our potential for compassion and self-sacrifice, the last few thousand years of wars, slavery, tortures, and holocausts have shown humans can be extraordinarily selfish, callous, vicious, and cruel. While there has been considerable engagement with these issues, particularly in the area of moral psychology and ethics, this paper explores an evolutionary analysis relating to evolved resource-regulation strategies that can be called “care and share” versus “control and hold.” Control and hold are typical of primates that operate through intimidatory social hierarchies. Care and share are less common in non-human primates, but evolved radically in humans during our hunter-gatherer stage when our ancestors lived in relatively interdependent, small, mobile groups. In these groups, individualistic, self-focus, and self-promoting control and hold strategies (trying to secure and accumulate more than others) were shunned and shamed. These caring and sharing hunter-gatherer lifestyles also created the social contexts for the evolution of new forms of childcare and complex human competencies for language, reasoning, planning, empathy, and self-awareness. As a result of our new ‘intelligence’, our ancestors developed agriculture that reduced mobility, increased group size, resource availability and storage, and resource competition. These re-introduced competing for, rather than sharing of, resources and advantaged those who now pursue (often aggressively) control and hold strategies. Many of our most typical forms of oppressive and anti-compassionate behavior are the result of these strategies. Rather than (just) thinking about individuals competing with one another, we can also consider these different resource regulation strategies as competing within populations shaping psychophysiological patterns; both wealth and poverty change the brain. One of the challenges to creating a more compassionate society is to find ways to create the social and economic conditions that regulate control and hold strategies and promote care and share. No easy task.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> IT'S</strong><strong> HELPS</strong><strong> PO</strong></p><p><strong>CORRECT</strong><strong> ME</strong><strong> IF</strong><strong> IM</strong><strong> </strong><strong>WRONG</strong></p><p><strong>PA </strong><strong>BRAINLY</strong></p><p><strong>AT </strong><strong>PA </strong><strong>FOLLOW </strong><strong>NA </strong><strong>DIN </strong><strong>PO</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Mother Earth,</p><p> </p><p>Here’s to you, the first mother I knew. You’re where I was born, where I continue to grow, where I eat, and play, and love. I call you by a human name, but I know your nature is greater and more ancient than humankind. We are just one of the youngest of your many children—and maybe the most rebellious.</p><p> </p><p>I’m an ever-curious mind seeking out meaning within things that can’t be explained by our little brains. I’ve settled on the notion that you create magic beyond the realms of science or philosophy.</p><p> </p><p>As I’ve grown, I’ve found myself fortunate enough to enjoy your presence time and time again. Whiling away hours amongst your trees, along your rivers, and atop your peaks. I take solace in your warmth; you always welcome me with open arms to places some others of my kind do not. Through no fault of your own, your open fields have been fenced off and stamped with a false sense of ownership. For those lucky enough to take their first breaths and first steps far from the gray of towns and cities, your green pastures are home.</p><p> </p><p>And for them, as for everyone, home is safety.</p><p> </p><p>That sense of safety shifts with my presence. My skin too dark, my hair too unstraight. The lies they’ve been told over centuries seeping into their unconscious, making them fear our outward differences. A fear that intensifies toward those with skin tones even darker than mine. Eyes that can’t help but glance or stare from a place of discomfort. But still I continue loving you, not allowing their discomfort to keep me from you.</p><p> </p><p>You are a source of hope. The kind of hope that’s necessary right now given what we’ve done to you. We’ve created systems to exploit. We’ve even given a name to your generous offerings: resources. We all get lost in ourselves sometimes—forgetting we’re forever connected to you. When we breathe your air, drink your water, use your herbs to heal us when we’re sick, we silently thank you.</p><p> </p><p>My presence is the best gift I can give to you now—an awareness of you in every moment. And a promise to fight for you in every way I can.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>good luck </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Mother Earth,</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We would first like to say thank you. Thank you for sheltering and nurturing us, for this common house that you have created for the entire human race. . Thank you for the water that we drink, and the sea that we excitedly plunge in every hot summer day. Thank you for the ground that we walk on, the very ground that we learn to ride bike on even if we fall, you are there to catch. A lot of our memories on this beautiful planet are enriched with your subtle yet beautiful touches. </p><p></p><p>Thank you for the food, the nutrients, the materials and the resources that provide for us. Thank you for our lives on this planet, with all the creatures that exist with us, and for us. Thank you for creating an endless playground for our adventurous souls.</p><p></p><p>But we also apologize for not being so kind with you lately. We apologizing for hurting you and pushing you to the limit.</p><p></p><p>We are sorry for making you and ourselves breathe polluted air. Factories and vehicles keep making greenhouse gases, which hurts you and causes millions of each year deaths among our kind. We are some that we have contaminated the water resources. While the Earth's fresh water is accessible to humans, about half of the rivers and streams are polluted and unsafe. We are sorry for making the temperature less tolerable.</p><p>We apologize for all the exploitation and destruction. Forest are burning, animals are dying. Extraction of natural resources has been growing steadily all over the world.</p><p>We are grateful for what you have given us, but we have also taken it for granted. At least we have realized that the climate issues are among the most urgent of our time, and we are taking action before it is too late. Leaders are holding conferences, citizens are speaking up. And after all, changes can be made by each of us, from the smallest actions in our daily lives. On the occasion of today, we take a vow to lessen the damage, and to not cause any unnecessary harm. We promise that the forests will stay green, animals will stay healthy, the temperature will be fine for us to live into do more good things, step by step. We appreciate you, and we should do our best to cherish that..</p><br />
