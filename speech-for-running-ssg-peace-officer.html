Focus on developing a sense of compassion for others. Police work, at its foundation, is about protecting and serving people. To do this well, you have to see through the eyes of others, and try to feel what they do. Having compassion helps you make good decisions, especially in the heat of the moment1.</p><p>2. Write a resume and cover letter. Because the hiring process for a police officer role is often competitive, it can be beneficial to prepare an effective resume and cover letter</p><p>3. Take time to consider a different experience for each question and write it down – but don’t write a script. You don’t want to appear disingenuous or inflexible</p><br />

                            14. you’re running for the position of secretary in SSG and you won, what speech would you give? </h2><br />
                        <p>Hi! I’m (your name) and I’m running for secretary of Supreme Student Government, I am a grade ___ student here. Instead of discussing the superfluous and dulldetail of my life,</p><p>I’ll get straight to the point. Why I want to be a member of Supreme Student Government? It is simply because I want to be acquainted to those old and newstudents here in (school name) not because I want to be known or to be praised by everyone but to know what are the things I need to do and the thing that I should not do inimproving the school. As a new student here, one of my reason is that I wanted to become aliaison in between the student body and the administration. When I informed my friends about my interest to run as a secretary, most immediately, others are asking me how can I balance my life since I have my studies needed to be focused. Well, they might think that I can’t do it, or might also think I can. Yes! Both of these opinions are right. Why? To become one of the officers is really difficult to those who do not know how to find strategies and techniques to make the tasks given more lighter. If ever I win, I will still not forget my first priority which is my studies, though the role of being an officer is still important, academics must come first. My primary reason of going to (your academic level) is to take classes and do well in them. But what makes me the candidate for secretary? I have several qualities that I feel would make me an effective and good secretary of SSG. Having spent my (previous academic level) years as one of the classroom and SSG officers, I consider myself extremely dedicated. It’s important for an officer to be dedicated to their job because slacking off will only result into disappointment. As the former (previous position) of (SSG, etc.) on my previous school, I have proven myself as responsible already. Being an officer requires crucial responsibilities for which many individuals are depending on you. I was appointed before as the secretary on our church which is similar to SSG, coordinates between students and the administration.Experience, dedication, and responsibility mean nothing, however, without someone who is willing to work hard. In my classes, my various on-campus and off- campus (working student), I can really say that I can maintain an excellent work dynamic. These are some of the things I’ve done that might help me become a good Student Government Officer. Whether I might lose or win this election, I still wanted to emphasize my concrete and observable goals for this school, co-students and to my community as a candidate for SSG secretary. As a secretary, I should write the minutes by hand and utilize my special handwriting and spelling skills ( I pride myself in being my own spell-check). I will make the minutes clear, concise and interesting to be read for all students. Like past secretaries, I will also write up summaries of Supreme Student Government meetings andinitiatives and place these updates in restrooms around the campus. Additionally, the secretary is supposed to have communication with the other officers, something that I will commit to as a way of gaining insight and making our own Student Government more effective. It is crucially important to remember, however, that besides the specific secretarial duties, these are General Student Council responsibilities an SSG officer must fulfill.</p><p></p><p>But try to make your own speech based on your past experiences, and use this as your guide</p><p></p><p>Btw can you make it the brainliest?

After all, </strong><strong>he</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>she </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> only been at our school for two years."</strong><p></p>It's true that I am fairly new to (YOUR SCHOOL). At first glance, this may seem like a disadvantage. I didn't attend this school for my freshman and sophomore years, and I've only known most of you for a couple of years.When you think about it though, there is actually a benefit in choosing someone who is coming into the school from somewhere else. I have new ideas that I can bring in from the school I was at before.Are you tired of doing the same old things year after year? Are you ready to do something different?One thing I noticed about this school when I came last year is that most of the students didn't really get to make any of the decisions here at the school.Did anyone ever ask you what you wanted to do for a fundraiser? Did anyone ever ask you what you wanted to buy with the money we raised? Who makes these decisions?Those types of decisions are left up to student council. The person you choose to represent you as president will speak for the entire senior class. Do you want to choose someone who will make those decisions for you without knowing what you want?If you vote for me as student council president, I promise to always get your opinions before making any decisions. You should have a say in the actions that will affect you.Every single one of you can come to me with your ideas, and I promise to listen and speak for you.<p></p><strong>I may not be the most well-known person running for student council president, but I promise to listen to each and every one of you.</strong><strong>I may not be the most well-known person running for student council president, but I promise to listen to each and every one of you.You matter.

I think some of my suggestions will help us increase our spending capacity and enable us to take a fantastic class vacation.</p><p></p><p>I believe I am <strong>qualified</strong> for this position in part because I have experience handling and managing a budget. My mother is actually the Chief Financial Officer of my parents' business, so I believe that I can use the skills she has imparted to manage our budget. I am highly skilled at handling money sensibly. If given the chance to serve as your representative, I would endeavor to use the budget wisely so that we could make savings while still having plenty of money.</p><p></p><p>I also have suggestions for how to increase that money if I'm elected. As a group, we can invest in stocks in hopes of seeing our money double or even treble. Let's now discuss particular tasks and my strategy for using the budget. If I were elected, I would ask the class to decide at the start of the year whether we wanted to use our budget for lots of little extracurricular events and a cheap field trip. An extremely large class trip might also be planned if we decided to save all the money and just use it for a few activities throughout the year.</p><p></p><p>You should have complete <strong>control</strong> over where your money goes since it is your money in the first place. If you elect me as treasurer, I will not make any purchases without first getting your approval. I would just be there to help with coordination and make sure everything gets done. A suggestion box would also be available in case you had any ideas for fun piza nights or celebrations that we could explore as a class. I've said it before, and I'm sure I can keep it: whatever we spend our money on is absolutely up to you.</p><p></p><p>We can definitely make this year <strong>amazing</strong>, in my opinion. If you choose to elect me, I'll make sure that every dollar is spent <strong>carefully</strong> and that my records are reliable. You have my complete attention.

                        <p><strong>Good afternoon everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>Peace is something good for the world. </strong>How can we feel it? We can feel it when our family is around us, and our relationship with our friends and neighbors is happy or joyful. Our desire to love or cherish, accept or strengthen relationships, that's when we feel peace.</p><p>Also, that peace means following what our hearts say, and it means close trust and respect for those around me. Peace begins with oneself, so I end this speech by stating, "Peace begins with a smile".</p><p>In principle, each individual has different thoughts, different interests, and different destinies, then what do we gain from all this, with this world peace day if we make it happen with the reality of real peace so that we all feel comfortable wrapped in beauty without hostility?</p><p>Talking about this world peace day cannot be separated from a historical meaning of the occurrence of this day of peace, precisely in 1981 including Israel and Palestine, on 21 September the United Nations determined a world peace day, namely the celebration of world peace day on 21 September every year. </p><p>Apart from that, peace is a moral and a desire for all mankind, indeed life is full of risks but how can we create a culture of harmony and peace, that let us maintain peace between humans and hopefully on this day of world peace is not just a mere slogan, but we create and apply it from the smallest thing, namely from ourselves.</p><p><strong>Dear peace officer, thank you for your dedication to maintaining, fighting for, and defending world peace. </strong>Without the efforts and sacrifices of peace officer, perhaps the world would be in a worse situation. Thank you and best appreciation to peace officer.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you and good afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more at https://brainly.ph/question/29350348</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
