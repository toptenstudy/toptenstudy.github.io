                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Write out your goals. Goals should be realistic. It's good to dream and to challenge yourself, but your goals should relate to your personal strengths and abilities. Goals should be specific. Goals should have a time frame. You should really want to reach the goal.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>•First, you need to know what your goals are. If you haven’t already, write them down. Put them in order of importance to you. Then, for your top goal, figure out what you need to do to accomplish this goal. (Write these things down too.) Break these down into monthly, then weekly goals. Finally, write down daily tasks that you can complete and get them done. Every day, do one small thing to move closer to your chosen goal.</p><p></p><p>The best way to achieve your goals is to take action, everyday. Once you start doing this, you will be able to complete more and more of your goals and you will be unstoppable!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>•for me, My greatest achievement is my friends. I’m so happy that I’ve talked to the people I’m talking to now. I don’t know where I’d be. I’m happy that I went that extra step out of my comfort zone to talk to new people. And how rewarding it’s been.</p><p></p><p>I now have a shoulder to cry on, and they have my shoulder too. I can tell them about pretty much everything.</p><p></p><p>Never take your friends for granted. Sure, grades are important and your education is important too, but most of the stuff you’re learning right now you won’t remember in 10 years. You won’t care about that one quiz you failed, walking across the stage during graduation.</p><p></p><p>What you’ll remember and what you’ll have till the end is your friends.</p><p></p><p>Sure, I’ve accomplished other things in my academic life. But one accomplishment that outshines them all is the fact that I made friends that I won’t forget—and I think that beats any academic acheivement I could ever accomplish.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Succeeding in college is rather like succeeding in life. It’s really much more about you than it is about college. So the most important place to start is to consider why you’re here, what matters to you, and what you expect to get out it. Even if you have already thought about these questions, it’s good to reaffirm your commitment to your plan as we begin to consider what’s really involved in being a college student. Let’s take a look at successful student have goals.</p><p></p><p>A group of people sitting on bench near trees during daytime. This can set a purpose and a direction for students. It can increase students’ day-to-day and semester-to-semester motivation because they see that each course is part of a greater whole that will help them in the future. This can also help with persistence, with keeping at it when things are tough. There will be challenges during your college career. There may be times you feel like giving up or you just don’t feel like going to class, reading your textbook, or writing that paper. Having that purpose, that long term goal can help you decide to move past that challenge and keep going. We call this resiliency.</p><p>Goals help you set priorities and remain motivated and committed to your college success. Setting a long term goal usually leads to setting medium and short term goals. These are practical goals related to being a student that can help you make better decisions when considering your choices of how to spend your time. Setting priorities with shorter term goals can help you see what you need to do next. Working through goals can help you feel more in control and can reduce stress.</p><p>Attitude is the largest factor determining success in college. Work to stay positive and surround yourself with positive people, and you’ll find you are motivated to carry out the activities that will help you succeed in your courses.</p><p></p><p>Goal Setting</p><p>A goal is a result we intend to reach mostly through our own actions.</p><p>Things we do may move us closer to or farther away from that result. Studying moves us closer to success in a difficult course, while sleeping through the final examination may completely prevent reaching that goal. That’s fairly obvious in an extreme case, yet still a lot of college students don’t reach their goal of graduating. The problem may be a lack of commitment to the goal, but often students have conflicting goals. One way to prevent problems is to think about all your goals and priorities and to learn ways to manage your time, your studies, and your social life to best reach your goals.</p><p></p><p>It all begins with setting goals and thinking about priorities.</p><p>Blue marker on white printer paper.</p><p>Photo by Estée Janssens on Unsplash</p><p>As you think about your own goals, think about more than just being a student. You’re also a person with individual needs and desires, hopes and dreams, plans and schemes. Your long-term goals likely include graduation and a career but may also involve social relationships with others, a romantic relationship, family, hobbies or other activities, where and how you live, and so on. While you are a student, you may not be actively pursuing all your goals with the same fervor, but they remain goals and are still important in your life.</p><p></p><p>Goals also vary in terms of time.</p><p>Short-term goals focus on today and the next few days and perhaps weeks.</p><p>Midterm goals involve plans for this school year and the time you plan to remain in college.</p><p>Long-term goals may begin with graduating college and everything you want to happen thereafter.</p><p>Often your long-term goals (e.g., the kind of career you want) guide your midterm goals (getting the right education for that career), and your short term goals (such as doing well on an exam) become steps for reaching those larger goals. Thinking about your goals in this way helps you realize how even the little things you do every day can keep you moving toward your most important long-term goals.</p><p></p><p>Write out your goals.</p><p>You should literally write them down, because the act of finding the best words to describe your goals helps you think more clearly about them.</p><p></p><p>Follow these guidelines:</p><p></p><p>Goals should be realistic. It’s good to dream and to challenge yourself, but your goals should relate to your personal strengths and abilities.</p><p>Goals should be specific. Don’t write, “I will become a great musician;” instead, write, “I will finish my music degree and be employed in a symphony orchestra.”</p><p>Goals should have a time frame. You won’t feel very motivated if your goal is vaguely “to finish college someday.” If you’re realistic and specific in your goals, you should also be able to project a time frame for reaching the goal.</p><p>You should really want to reach the goal. We’re willing to work hard to reach goals we really care about, but we’re likely to give up when we encounter obstacles if we don’t feel strongly about a goal. If you’re doing something only because your parents or someone else wants you to, then it’s not your own personal goal</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
