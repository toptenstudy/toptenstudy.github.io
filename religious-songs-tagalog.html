There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures? In this activity, you will also use the same.

                        Music of Lowlands of Luzon (Folk Songs from the Lowlands)<p></p><p>→ <strong>You can see the table in the picture below.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Further explanation:</strong><p>Consequently, the first dance, which is clearly <strong>the nucleus</strong> when identifying the four dances from the photographs, involves bamboos that are used to produce the beat as dancers move around the bamboos in time with the beat. Because molong is a sort of skirt that is typically worn in the stands and is what the individuals appear to be wearing, the second one resembles <strong>Gamelon Malone</strong>. The second 1 therefore consists of a couple of lengthy malone. </p><p></p><p>The third number is called <strong>Venus 1</strong>, since it is the number when ladies specifically balance cups on their heads and in their hands while dancing, as shown in the third figure. The fourth image suggests something moglaletic, so <strong>maglai</strong>. Since it is the dance in which men wear cocoanut shells essentially on top of their clothing or merely on their bodies somewhere and dance while the cocoanut shells are involved, as the fourth image shows, that is what the fourace are. </p><p></p><p>The simple vocal and instrumental music of Luzon's lowlands is essentially the result of the daily experiences of people like farmers, fisherman, artisans, vendors, and other regular people. Members of the family or community acquired this music orally and sung it in their own language. Most of the original composers of this music were unidentified. </p><p></p><p>Songs are written or sung in the <strong>local dialect</strong> and are based on the people's day-to-day experiences in a particular location. The lyrics of the songs must be easily understood in order to be appreciated. For instance, Tagalog folk music were created by Tagalog speakers. Leron Sinta, Bahay Kubo, and Magtanim ay "Di Biro" Ilocanos have their own dialect (Manang Biday and Pamulinawen).

Because molong is a sort of skirt that is typically worn in the stands and is what the individuals appear to be wearing, the second one resembles <strong>Gamelon Malone</strong>. The second 1, therefore, consists of a couple of lengthy Malone.</p><p></p><p>The third number is called <strong>Venus 1</strong> since it is the number when ladies specifically balance cups on their heads and in their hands while dancing, as shown in the third figure. The fourth image suggests something <strong>moglaletic</strong>, so maglai. Since it is the dance in which men wear cocoanut shells essentially on top of their clothing or merely on their bodies somewhere and dance while the cocoanut shells are involved, as the fourth image shows, that is what the fourace are.</p><p></p><p>The simple vocal and instrumental music of Luzon's lowlands is essentially the result of the daily experiences of people like farmers, fishermen, artisans, vendors, and other regular people. Members of the family or community acquired this music orally and sang it in their own language. Most of the original composers of this music were unidentified.</p><p></p><p>Songs are written or sung in the <strong>local dialect</strong> and are based on the people's day-to-day experiences in a particular location. The lyrics of the songs must be easily understood in order to be appreciated. For instance, Tagalog folk music were created by Tagalog speakers. Leron Sinta, Bahay Kubo, and Magtanim ay "Di Biro" Ilocanos have their own dialect (Manang Biday and Pamulinawen).

Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures?
