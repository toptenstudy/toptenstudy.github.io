                                            New York — The most fabulous musical in the history of the stage has been made into a fabulous musical film, one that will be one of the greatest hits in movie history. It is, of course, My Fair Lady, a Warner Bros. presentation, a personal production of Jack L. Warner, and it is a better movie than it was a play ... The picture is exquisite, extraordinary, a unique gem of filmmaking. One of those rare, rare occasions when everything goes right, when it keeps going right and it moves and takes the spectator along, enchanted and enthralled. George Cukor's direction is as fresh and crisp as a first night, electric with dramatic tension, keyed high and held. Visually there has never — not ever — been a motion picture to equal the breath taking loveliness of My Fair Lady. Technicolor might have been invented for the vivid profusion of color that is splashed on the screen. It is such a pretty picture. But far more is the fact that it is a witty film, and earthy film, with humor that ranges from the sophisticated conversation of George Bernard Shaw at his most recondite to Shaw at his most daring — with an assist from Alan Jay Lerner. It is tremulous with sentiment and rich with an unusual love story. It has perhaps the most nearly universal of themes. It incarnates the dream of almost everyone: to be bewitched or transmuted and awake to be handsome or beautiful, and the beloved of one's idol.1.Which movie was being described in these paragraphs?A.

                                            2. Among the breakthroughs that happened throughout human history, it is perhaps digitization that best defines our current age. Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</a>

                                            I define history as important events that have happened in the past, and the ones that are presently happening. At some time or another everything will be considered history. History tells a story, whether it’s written, painted, carved, or sung; a collection of events that someone explains to you that is usually important. When most people think about history they remember a boring class they took in school a long time ago, they recall memorizing important dates, taking map tests, and falling asleep while listening to a lecture. The truth is that history really is an important subject to be teaching students. History is more than just some lecture you receive in class, history lets us look back, see the good things and the bad things, it allows us to learn from our mistakes and prevent such mistakes from happening in the future. Things that happened in the past are still changing things that are happening today. History is needed for everyone, from government leaders down to individuals; everyone has learned one thing or another from history at some point in their life. History is everywhere today. I don’t think some people really realize how broad the word history really is. Basically when someone hears the word history they automatically think of some sort of culture like the ancient Egyptians, or some important date like December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the United States officially entered the Second World War. But people don’t really realize there are so many other types of history. World leaders are making history with wars, conflicts, and new laws; movies are making history by selling outrageous numbers of tickets, athletes are making history by setting records everyday, and students are making history by graduating college. Every part of what you do is some type of history As corny as this sounds, history really does have a way of repeating itself. It’s up to the people like us, the future leaders of the country to decide if the good things or the bad things are the ones that will repeat themselves. Events that lead to the stock market crash, which lead to the great depression are being avoided, things that lead countries to war are being dealt with today in a different manner because no one wants another world war, Democracy, the longest standing form of government in the United States, is being spread around the world to avoid such conflicts that occurred with dictatorships in the past, and the newest problem.​</a>

                            6. New York — The most fabulous musical in the history of the stage has been made into a fabulous musical film, one that will be one of the greatest hits in movie history. It is, of course, My Fair Lady, a Warner Bros. presentation, a personal production of Jack L. Warner, and it is a better movie than it was a play ... The picture is exquisite, extraordinary, a unique gem of filmmaking. One of those rare, rare occasions when everything goes right, when it keeps going right and it moves and takes the spectator along, enchanted and enthralled. George Cukor's direction is as fresh and crisp as a first night, electric with dramatic tension, keyed high and held. Visually there has never — not ever — been a motion picture to equal the breath taking loveliness of My Fair Lady. Technicolor might have been invented for the vivid profusion of color that is splashed on the screen. It is such a pretty picture. But far more is the fact that it is a witty film, and earthy film, with humor that ranges from the sophisticated conversation of George Bernard Shaw at his most recondite to Shaw at his most daring — with an assist from Alan Jay Lerner. It is tremulous with sentiment and rich with an unusual love story. It has perhaps the most nearly universal of themes. It incarnates the dream of almost everyone: to be bewitched or transmuted and awake to be handsome or beautiful, and the beloved of one's idol.1.Which movie was being described in these paragraphs?A.

Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</h2><br />

                            20. I define history as important events that have happened in the past, and the ones that are presently happening. At some time or another everything will be considered history. History tells a story, whether it’s written, painted, carved, or sung; a collection of events that someone explains to you that is usually important. When most people think about history they remember a boring class they took in school a long time ago, they recall memorizing important dates, taking map tests, and falling asleep while listening to a lecture. The truth is that history really is an important subject to be teaching students. History is more than just some lecture you receive in class, history lets us look back, see the good things and the bad things, it allows us to learn from our mistakes and prevent such mistakes from happening in the future. Things that happened in the past are still changing things that are happening today. History is needed for everyone, from government leaders down to individuals; everyone has learned one thing or another from history at some point in their life. History is everywhere today. I don’t think some people really realize how broad the word history really is. Basically when someone hears the word history they automatically think of some sort of culture like the ancient Egyptians, or some important date like December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the United States officially entered the Second World War. But people don’t really realize there are so many other types of history. World leaders are making history with wars, conflicts, and new laws; movies are making history by selling outrageous numbers of tickets, athletes are making history by setting records everyday, and students are making history by graduating college. Every part of what you do is some type of history As corny as this sounds, history really does have a way of repeating itself. It’s up to the people like us, the future leaders of the country to decide if the good things or the bad things are the ones that will repeat themselves. Events that lead to the stock market crash, which lead to the great depression are being avoided, things that lead countries to war are being dealt with today in a different manner because no one wants another world war, Democracy, the longest standing form of government in the United States, is being spread around the world to avoid such conflicts that occurred with dictatorships in the past, and the newest problem.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"History repeats itself"</p><p>First of all what is history repeats itself, its is when something has happened in the past recurs in the present, its like in the past century that we have so many pandemics like in 1720 plague,1820 cholera outbreak,1920 spanish flu, and right now we have the COVID-19 </p><p>Some examples of history repeating itself are Napoleon and hitler invading russia, the great recession an the great depression.</p><p>theres a saying that history repeat itself sometimes it's in the context of being told to learn from our mistakes so that history doesn't repeat itself.</p><p>History is the study of change over time, and it covers all aspects of human society. Political, social, economic, scientific, technological, medical, cultural, intellectual, religious and military developments are all part of history.</p><p></p><p>I define history as important events that have happened in the past, and the ones that are presently happening.
