                                            Jane, who is now 19 years old, has lived with her grandparents since she was a month old. Her parents worked in Japan as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). They do, however, keep in touch practically every day via social media. Her grandparents and parents describe her as a person who is picky about the friends with whom she forms tight bonds. Her grandparents saw that she chooses friends who share her characteristics and demonstrate the principles she espouses. She understands, however, that she cannot choose her family or the individuals with whom she will have to work in school and at her future workplace. Her pal describes her as a straightforward but discreet girl who is caring, fun to be around, insightful, and even filled with life's wisdom despite her young age. Her friends also noted that she respects her friends' individuality and treats them as equals, but always with the utmost respect. She does not take things subjectively, but rather objectively and based on facts, and she also researches. She is not judgmental and can connect with people from all walks of life. Her grandparents also noticed that the majority of her friends are 20 years older than she is. How would you characterize Jane's philosophical self? Back up your claim.​</a>
