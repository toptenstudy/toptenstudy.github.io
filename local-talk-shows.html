                                            Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</a>

Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
them within their imagined community.

                                                 Mining with Responsibility
The people were happy that a copper mine was set up in
their town. It gave jobs to many. But their joy was short-lived. After two years, the river was no longer clear. It had turned gray. The riverbed looked as if it was full of mud. The water was murky. There were no signs of frogs, aquatic plants or moss. There were also no
signs of fish. The people could no longer fish. Those who bathed and washed clothes in the river got sick.
Then, a chemistry teacher in a nearby college came with his
students. They were on a field trip. The mining officers took them on a guided tour of the facility. They also took water samples from the river. They had pictures taken of it. They talked to some people who had come to watch what they were doing. 
After a few months, the results of the study came out. It
turned out that a big volume of mine tailings had spilled into the river. 
The chief executive officer of the mining company became
angry. He refused to accept the findings of the chemistry teacher. He suggested to the college authorities to dismiss the teacher but the college did not dismiss him. The teacher did not want to cause
trouble between the college and the mining company. So, he resigned.
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources told the mining company to pay a fine. This amount would be used to pay for the claims of affected local residents. The mining
company was also ordered to plug the leak and clean up the
river. They would have to correct the problem as required by law. Or else, they would not be able to continue to operate.
The mining company had to accept their mistake. They did
everything that the DENR told them to do. They wanted the town people to regain their livelihood. They wanted them to be able to bathe and wash clothes in the river without getting sick. They wanted to show to the community that they could mine with
responsibility.</a>

                            9. Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</h2><br />

Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed

                            29.      Mining with Responsibility
The people were happy that a copper mine was set up in
their town. It gave jobs to many. But their joy was short-lived. After two years, the river was no longer clear. It had turned gray. The riverbed looked as if it was full of mud. The water was murky. There were no signs of frogs, aquatic plants or moss. There were also no
signs of fish. The people could no longer fish. Those who bathed and washed clothes in the river got sick.
Then, a chemistry teacher in a nearby college came with his
students. They were on a field trip. The mining officers took them on a guided tour of the facility. They also took water samples from the river. They had pictures taken of it. They talked to some people who had come to watch what they were doing. 
After a few months, the results of the study came out. It
turned out that a big volume of mine tailings had spilled into the river. 
The chief executive officer of the mining company became
angry. He refused to accept the findings of the chemistry teacher. He suggested to the college authorities to dismiss the teacher but the college did not dismiss him. The teacher did not want to cause
trouble between the college and the mining company. So, he resigned.
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources told the mining company to pay a fine. This amount would be used to pay for the claims of affected local residents. The mining
company was also ordered to plug the leak and clean up the
river. They would have to correct the problem as required by law. Or else, they would not be able to continue to operate.
The mining company had to accept their mistake. They did
everything that the DENR told them to do. They wanted the town people to regain their livelihood. They wanted them to be able to bathe and wash clothes in the river without getting sick. They wanted to show to the community that they could mine with
responsibility.</h2><br />
