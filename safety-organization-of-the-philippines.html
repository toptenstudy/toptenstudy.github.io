Just recently, weprovided tents to the Department of Health (DOH) to support the management of COVID-19 cases requiring hospital care.DOH is further strengthening its capacity in hospital preparedness, rapid response, riskcommunication, and information dissemination with full support from UNICEF Philippines.UNICEF is working with DOH to take appropriate measures for the continuous delivery ofother essential public health services including access to water, sanitation and hygiene,mental health and psychosocial support, and nutrition."We are intent on staying on the ground working to mitigate impact on children and theirfamilies including pushing back against stigma associated with vulnerable groups," saidWigdan Madani, UNICEF's Chief of Health &amp; Nutrition, "and we remain concerned byrelated control measures including school closures, the burden on local health systemsfor the delivery of primary care, protection risks, and economic pressures felt by families."With the suspension of classes in all levels within Metro Manila and in selected LGUsuntil 12 April 2020, UNICEF Philippines encourages schools to plan continuity forlearning. We urge communities, caregivers, and parents to stay informed about COVID-19 through trusted sources like the DOH, local government units, WHO, and UNICEF torecognize symptoms, coordinate with schools to support safety efforts, and help childrencope with the stress caused by the current situation.Characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has becomedeadlier. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the disease's geographical spread.

UNICEF Philippines Statement on COVID-19 MANILA, 13 March 2020 - Following President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration placing Metro Manila under lockdown from 15 March 2020 to 14 April 2020, UNICEF Philippines remains steadfast in working with the Philippine Government and partners to stop the transmission of the virus and to keep children and their families safe. UNICEF Philippines has been fully supporting the Government's emergency response as early as the first few cases of COVID-19 were identified in the country. Just recently, we provided tents to the Department of Health (DOH) to support the management of COVID- 19 cases requiring hospital care. DOH is further strengthening its capacity in hospital preparedness, rapid response, risk communication, and information dissemination with full support from UNICEF Philippines. UNICEF is working with DOH to take appropriate measures for the continuous delivery of other essential public health services including access to water, sanitation and hygiene, mental health and psychosocial support, and nutrition. "We are intent on staying on the ground working to mitigate impact on children and their families including pushing back against stigma associated with vulnerable groups," said Wigdan Madani, UNICEF's Chief of Health &amp; Nutrition, "and we remain concerned by related control measures including school closures, the burden on local health systems for the delivery of primary care, protection risks, and economic pressures felt by families." With the suspension of classes in all levels within Metro Manila and in selected LGUs until 12 April 2020, UNICEF Philippines encourages schools to plan continuity for learning. We urge communities, caregivers, and parents to stay informed about COVID- 19 through trusted sources like the DOH, local government units, WHO, and UNICEF to recognize symptoms, coordinate with schools to support safety efforts, and help children cope with the stress caused by the current situation. Characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has become deadlier. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the disease's geographical spread. Let's continue to prepare and respond to the epidemic to protect children and families in the Philippines.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>As the country continues to confront different issues brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Department of Education (DepEd) is addressing the challenges in the basic education for the school year 2020-2021 through its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) under DepEd Order No. 012, s. 2020.</p><p>The BE-LCP is consistent with the mandate of Section 1, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution for the state to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and to take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all. Under Section 6, Chapter 1 of Republic Act No. 9155, or the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, DepEd is vested with the authority, accountability, and responsibility for ensuring access to, promoting equity in, and improving the quality of basic education.</p><p>Hence, the BE-LCP aims to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the learners, teachers, and personnel in the time of COVID-19, while finding ways for education to continue amidst the crisis. In particular, the BE-LCP has been designed with a legal framework responsive to the “new normal,” keeping in mind the constitutional mandate to uphold the right of all citizens to quality education at all times.</p><p>In line with this, the learning delivery modalities that schools can adopt may be one or a combination of the following, depending on the local health conditions, the availability of resources, and the particular context of the learners in the school or locality:</p><p>1. Face-to-face. This refers to a modality where the students and the teacher are both physically present in the classroom, and there are opportunities for active engagement, immediate feedback, and socio-emotional development of learners. Notably, this modality is feasible only in very low risk areas with no history of infection, easily monitored external contacts, and with teachers and learners living in the vicinity of the school.</p><p>2. Distance learning. This refers to a modality where learning takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction. This modality has three types, namely: Modular Distance Learning, Online Distance Learning, and Television/Radio-Based Instruction. This is most viable for independent learners, and learners supported by periodic supervision of parents or guardians.</p><p>3. Blended Learning.This refers to a learning delivery that combines face-to-face with any, or a mix of, Modular Distance Learning, Online Distance Learning, and Television/Radio-Based Instruction. Blended learning will enable the schools to limit face-to-face learning, ensure social distancing, and decrease the volume of people outside the home at any given time.</p><p>4. Homeschooling. This modality aims to provide learners with quality basic education that is facilitated by qualified parents, guardians, or tutors who have undergone relevant training in a home-based environment. However, this modality will be the subject of a later DepEd issuance since there remain several issues in its implementation, including the supervision of licensed teachers and alignments with the standard curriculum.</p><p>In application, however, the BE-LCP is confronted with different challenges.</p><p>First, in the implementation of the various learning delivery modalities, the challenge will be in dealing with learners under any of the modes of distance learning or blended learning who are not capable of learning independently, or who are not periodically supported by their parents or guardians. Also critical for the implementation will be the mass production of the needed teachers and learners’ learning materials, as well as the support of media institutions like TV and radio stations.</p><p>Second, DepEd will need substantial and additional financial resources in order to meet the objectives of the BE-LCP. This is where the support of the respective local government units, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders become indispensable.</p><p>Third, the holistic development of students will likely be affected. With the BE-LCP in place, the students will have limited opportunities for interaction with their teachers and classmates. Thus, their learning outcomes may be affected, and there may be negative impacts on the students who cannot easily cope with the change. This is where support interventions not only by DepEd but also by the family becomes relevant to mitigate this effect.</p><p>Verily, the learning environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic will be very different. Yet, the DepEd is optimistic that despite the various socio-economic situations of families which affect the provision of learning support in the home, and the peculiar needs of different learners, the BE-LCP could be the key to providing quality basic education which is accessible and responsive in the new normal</p><p></p><br />

In joint memorandum circular (JMC), the three agencies will release the guidelines on speed limits while creating coordinated mechanisms on their implementation on national roads to promote road safety. The signing is in support of Republic Act 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. Section 35 of the code states that motorists negotiating highways shall do so at a careful and prudent speed. It also calls for the drivers to drive within the speed limit so as not to endanger public safety. The agreement allows the national and local government units to coordinate with each other in enforcing the speed limits on various roads. Under section 38 of the Local Government Code, the LGUs are mandated to classify roads within their turfs in imposing the desired speed limits. Representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP), and the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) will provide support to the joint agreement O 3C​</h2><br />

UNICEF Philippines Statement on COVID-19 MANILA, 13 March 2020 - Following President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration placing Metro Manila under lockdown from 15 March 2020 to 14 April 2020, UNICEF Philippines remains steadfast in working with the Philippine Government and partners to stop the transmission of the virus and to keep children and their families safe. UNICEF Philippines has been fully supporting the Government's emergency response as early as the first few cases of COVID-19 were identified in the country. Just recently, we provided tents to the Department of Health (DOH) to support the management of COVID- 19 cases requiring hospital care. DOH is further strengthening its capacity in hospital preparedness, rapid response, risk communication, and information dissemination with full support from UNICEF Philippines. UNICEF is working with DOH to take appropriate measures for the continuous delivery of other essential public health services including access to water, sanitation and hygiene, mental health and psychosocial support, and nutrition. "We are intent on staying on the ground working to mitigate impact on children and their families including pushing back against stigma associated with vulnerable groups," said Wigdan Madani, UNICEF's Chief of Health &amp; Nutrition, "and we remain concerned by related control measures including school closures, the burden on local health systems for the delivery of primary care, protection risks, and economic pressures felt by families." With the suspension of classes in all levels within Metro Manila and in selected LGUs until 12 April 2020, UNICEF Philippines encourages schools to plan continuity for learning. We urge communities, caregivers, and parents to stay informed about COVID- 19 through trusted sources like the DOH, local government units, WHO, and UNICEF to recognize symptoms, coordinate with schools to support safety efforts, and help children cope with the stress caused by the current situation. Characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has become deadlier. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the disease's geographical spread. Let's continue to prepare and respond to the epidemic to protect children and families in the Philippines.
