Even though Philippines has an improved economy today, majority of the people living there is still struggling in poverty. People living in the Philippines are not enjoying the equal distribution of wealth, once they become poor, they will become so very poor, once they become rich, they will become so very rich. What is poverty? Economically, poverty happened when people does not meet all of their basic needs, they don’t meet the basic requirements to live better. It is the state that a person has a little or no money at all or few or no material possessions.  These people encountered struggles in life and probably cannot eat every day or every meal, can’t afford to buy clothes as protection to their body. They have no shelter to live.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hope it Helps</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#Carry on Learning<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.<p></p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> <strong>hope it helps:) </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty has a particularly adverse effect on the academic outcomes of children, especially during early childhood. Chronic stress associated with living in poverty has been shown to adversely affect children’s concentration and memory which may impact their ability to learn. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in 2008, the dropout rate of students living in low-income families was about four and one-half times greater than the rate of children from higher-income families (8.7 percent versus 2.0 percent). The academic achievement gap for poorer youth is particularly pronounced for low-income African American and Hispanic children compared with their more affluent White peers. Underresourced schools in poorer communities struggle to meet the learning needs of their students and aid them in fulfilling their potential. Inadequate education contributes to the cycle of poverty by making it more difficult for low-income children to lift themselves and future generations out of poverty.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>POVERTY AMONG HUMANS <p></p><p></p>Humans didn't just appear out of nowhere. They are products of evolution of millions of years. The current human genome is the result of countless mutations that occurred before the appearance of modern humans some 200,000 years and after it. Some of those mutations were really beneficial and lasted for a long time while some were outright bad or only situationally good. The tinkering with the genetic setup of a human for removal of any inefficient mutations and insertion of useful and better genes comes under transhumanism. In addition to ineffective mutations, there are also some mutations which are outright harmful and can cause different diseases and conditions. Transhumanism deals with these mutations and increases the lifespan of a person. Transhumanism is an active counter to aging. It makes a person smarter, stronger and energetic.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>https://myassignmenthelp.com/mah-bot-editor.html</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Poverty can be expressed differently from many viewpoints (Spector, 2013). Poverty is characterized by their physical, mental, and spiritual state. Physically, individuals can be affected by the environment or other factors, such as, their lifestyle. Mentally, individuals affected by poverty are not educated or do not have the opportunity for advancement. Spiritually, they find themselves feeling of hopelessness. Poverty can co-exist within many subcultures that reside is particular areas, consider California. In California, there are dense populations that live below the poverty line that is also a part of other subcultures. When income, education, and lifestyles are compromised many health issues can arise. To comeback these harsh lifestyles, many groups have come together to improve and educate people who currently live in poverty. Health educators also manipulate their strategic efforts to have the most impact on the community. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> YOU</strong><strong> UNDERSTAND</strong><strong> ❤️</strong></p><br />

About 9.2% of the world, or 689 million people, live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 a day, according to the World Bank.
