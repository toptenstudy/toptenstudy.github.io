2. Distinguish the limitations and possibilities for trancendence.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It’s a complex topic so i’m just going to give you some main point. There are many things that limit the human ability to transcend, first is that we often let our emotions cloud our judgement.We have the potential to solve our problem in a compromising and logical way but we let emotion get the better of us, there is nothing wrong with having emotion but let it took over your mind is what set you back from transcendence. Second is that we refuse to learn and open to new ideas and thought, sticking too much to traditional, conservative ideas and conformity prevent you from seeing the whole reality. A person who read a book can only see a picture of paradise, a person who read two book will see that something is not right and the one who read more than that will see that it’s just a picture and not reality. Third and final is that our limitation is a safety mechanism, meaning that our body will not allow us to transcend unless we are prepare too. They say that ignorance is bliss, knowing too much can drive you crazy but only if you are ignorant. Follow simple and small steps, refrain yourself from excessive social life, read more and change your way of thoughts. Only then will the body allow you to transcend safety…</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. How do we recognize our limitations and the possibilities of transcendence? Is our concept of spirituality affected the way we philosophize? In what ways?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>You have no fears. Fearlessness is the first sign of a spiritual person. ... You see things as they are. ... You don't speak ill of others or gossip. ... You are loving and kind. ... You believe that the soul is eternal. ... You meditate. ... You feel your life has a purpose. ... You take care of your mental and physical health.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Limitations and Possibilities of Transcendence?</p><p></p><p>Personally, my possibilities have always been determined by my limitations. Yet I have been gifted with some writing abilities and character qualities. Yet these never were enough to be successful in life like I wanted. When I committed to the Divine, then He added to it in ways I do not fully comprehend, only that I see it happening and experience it. So, my possibilities can be magnified and increased beyond my own solo limitations.</p><p></p><p>Transcendence for me has been going beyond this material world to the spiritual in the areas of my gifting even with limitations. My transcendence has occurred in many areas of my life, such as friendship, marriage, life purpose fulfillment, Christian faith and it has not stopped. I believe, in spite of our limitations, our possibilities to transcendence are unlimited except by the restraints of morality regarding ourself and others.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>wise man has said:</p><p></p><p>Religion without philosophy is fanaticism, and philosophy without religion is mental speculation.</p><p></p><p>If we translate spirituality into religion, real religion is backed by an explanatory philosophy. So spirituality and philosophy go hand in hand. Philosophy describes existential facts of living in the world, and spirituality means living life according to that philosophy. In the modern world, religion has been reduced to mere faith, but Spirituality or religion is not just a matter of faith. Religion must be based on empiric facts, not just belief. If religion cannot help us understand how nature works, and how we are meant to interact with nature, then what’s the use of that religion?</p><p></p><p>Religion and science are opposed ... but only in the same sense as that in which my thumb and forefinger are opposed - and between the two, one can grasp everything. - Sir William Bragg, Nobel Prize in Physics 1915</p><p></p><p>All living entities are spiritual in essence, for the soul in all living entities is a minute, spiritual spark of consciousness. Most living beings are not aware of their spiritual essence. In the lower species, for instance, there is no awareness of the soul. In the animal species there is total absorption of the consciousness in eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.</p><p></p><p>The human life-form is a very rare and unique opportunity for the soul to become aware of itself. But very few humans have any interest in becoming spiritually aware. Like in the lower species, they have elected to absorb themselves in their bodily identity, and the culture they happen to appear in.</p><p></p><p>Modern mankind is totally absorbed in eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Certainly, they may be more refined than animals. But a culture that revolves around gratifying a material body and mind, is basically an animal culture.</p><p></p><p>Even if humans are more refined in their material activities than animals - they may eat their food bought from a supermarket nicely wrapped in plastic, from porcelain plates with a knife and a fork, they may sleep or mate on box-spring mattresses, and defend themselves with missiles and high-tech bombs, but if they are not aware of themselves as souls, spiritually, they are no more advanced than animals that eat their food raw from some prey, sleep on the ground, and defend themselves with tooth and claw.</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual awareness a human being is no better than an animal.</p><p></p><p>It is spiritual understanding that makes a human a human, not the advancement of technology, or even the ability to read and write. What do they read and write about? What are all the great literature about? What’s on CNN and Fox news? It can all be boiled down to - eating, sleeping, mating, and defending</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest nalng</p><p></p><br />

                            23. How do we recognize our limitations and the possibilities of transcendence?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As nouns the difference between limit and transcendence</p><p></p><p> is that limit is a restriction; a bound beyond which one may not go while transcendence is (countable) the act of surpassing usual limits</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you are little you do not have the tools and understanding to deal with trauma so your transcendence is limited. When you have the tools you can go back to the trauma that cut your off, find the pre trauma self and transcend, defragment.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is very similar to Adam and Eve whose transcendence was cut short because it was premature and all children of theirs could not transcend without Christ, later on.
</p><p>
</p><p>The gospels are about going in reverse through the major judgments in the old testament from Moses to Adam and revisiting the original trauma in Eden and reversing it. Hippies were kind of neigh eve (pardon the pun) trying to get back to Eden by running around naked and being vegetarians.
</p><p>
</p><p>2 major things in transcendence
</p><p>Be still and know the eternal uncreated intelligence/power/love where you came from
</p><p>Recapitulate
</p><p>
</p><p>The Archetype of Recapitulation
</p><p>In the Old Testament
</p><p>1) man was judged by the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A cherubim and sword going every way like a flame (time?) blocked them from going back to Eden to eat of the tree of life.
</p><p>2) man was judged by a flood. A rainbow was evidence we could not go back to a world wide flood.
</p><p>3) man was judged by the law through Israel. Christ, Messiah crucified as the culmination of the law, was a sign we would not be judged by the law again.
</p><p>
</p><p>In reverse starting with Christ,
</p><p>3) The Law
</p><p>Israel left Egypt after the plague of the death of the firstborn and the first passover supper and went to sinai and got the law.
</p><p>In reverse Jesus’s mother and father named him and did all the law requirements and then fled to Egypt to escape Herod killing their first born.
</p><p>2) The Flood
</p><p>"At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Then he sent forth a dove from him,"... (Genesis 8:6-8...)
</p><p>In reverse Jesus was baptized by John/the raven, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove on Jesus. Then Jesus went into the wilderness 40 days.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove;"... (Luke 3:21-23...)
</p><p>John, the baptist, is related to Elijah “For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.”(Matthew 11:13, 14) Elijah was fed by ravens of the valley “You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.” (1 Kings 17:4 God speaking to Elijah). Elijah is to restore the hearts of the children to the fathers “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers,” (Malachi 4:5–6…). It is written “The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.” (Proverbs 30:17)
</p><p>1) Eden
</p><p>Satan tempted Eve, who gave to Adam to eat, forgetting God’s warning.
</p><p>In reverse at “the last supper” Christ, “the 2nd/last Adam” gave to his disciples “the bride of Christ”, to eat in remembrance. One of them was a devil (Judas).
</p><p>
</p><p>Where was Adam and Eve before they ate? In a garden being tempted.
</p><p>Where was the last Adam and his bride after they ate? In the garden of gethsemane being tempted.
</p><p>
</p><p>Christ goes back to where Eve was formed. This is taking us beyond shamanic healing or freudian healing recapitulating to heal a trauma in this life. This transcends what we were cut off from when Adam and Eve tried to transcend before they were ready. This connects us back to the eternal from where all true miracles come.
</p><p>
</p><p>Adam was put into a deep sleep and a helps meet was made from his side.
</p><p>Christ was put into a deep sleep, death. His side was opened with a spear, and water and blood came out. The bride of Christ are his witnesses by the spirit, water, and blood. "For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree." (1 John 5:7-8)
</p><p>When Christ died and Satan was judged a murderer, the Holy Spirit was free to come on the believers at pentecost, the life from God breathed into Eve through Christ and we are his witnesses on earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>The limitations and possibilities are whatever we ask the father for the purpose of locating and or drawing attention to Christ, He, the father, will do for us.
</p><p>
</p><p>Satan can only have power over the temporal things of matter but Christ has transcended to the eternal uncreated intelligence/power/love dwelling in the ultimate non things that define all things.</p><p></p><br />

                        One of the reasons so many people fail is that they’re not aware of their own limitations, nor do they know how to exploit them to their own advantage. We all have limitations, so there’s no use complaining about it. The best things is to be cognizant of them, and use them to move forward in life. Otherwise you risk being disorganized, getting involved in too many things, and eventually being disappointed. Of course, when I talk about limitations, I’m referring to both the physical and psychological kinds.<br />No matter who you are, or what position you occupy in society, you’re still a human being, and that means you have limits. You need to be aware of them to make progress, and eventually lead the life you want. We all have to do it, and you’re no exception to the rule.<br /><br />I hope it helps<br />
