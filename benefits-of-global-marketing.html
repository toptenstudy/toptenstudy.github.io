                                            Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</a>

                                            true or false1). Foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when a firm invests directly in facilities to produce or market a product in a foreign country. 2). According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, FDI occurs whenever a U.S. citizen, organization, or affiliated group takes an interest of 10 percent or more in a foreign business entity. 3. FDI takes in two main forms, the first is a greenfield investment, which involves the establishment of a new operation in a foreign country; and 4. The second involves acquiring or merging with an existing firm in the foreign country (most of Starbucks’ expansion has been in the form of greenfield Britain’s Seattle Coffee. 5. When discussing foreign direct investment, it is important to distinguish between the flow of FDI and the stock of FDI. 6. The flow of FDI refers to the amount of FDI undertaken over a given time period (normally a year). 7. The average yearly outflow of FDI increased from $25 billion in 1975 to a record $1.2 trillion in 2000. 8. Executives see FDI as a way of circumventing future trade barriers. 9. The globalization of the world economy is also having a positive impact on the volume of FDI. 10).During the 1980s and 1990s, the United States was often the favorite target for FDI inflows.11). Exporting involves producing goods at home and then shipping them to the receiving country for sale. 12). Licensing involves granting a foreign entity (the licensee) the right to produce and sell the firm’s product in return for a royalty fee on every unit sold. 13). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expensive because a firm must bear the costs of establishing production facilities in a foreign country or of acquiring a foreign enterprise. 14). when a firm allows another enterprise to produce its products under license, the license bear costs or risks. 15). The viability of an exporting strategy is often constrained by transportation costs and trade barriers. 16). By placing tariffs on imported goods, governments can increase the cost of exporting relative to foreign direct investment and licensing. 17). Licensing may result in a firm’s giving away valuable know- how to a potential foreign competitor. 18). Countries should specialize in the production of those goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. 19). The pragmatic nationalist view is that FDI has both benefits and costs. 20). When a foreign company rather than a domestic company produces products, the profits from that investment go abroad. ​</a>

The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19. Since the Ukraine invasion began on February 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with at least 140 yes votes. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special military operation" to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 20. Despite decades of international climate negotiations, carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily, with current emissions projections putting 1.5 degrees C well out of reach. 21. Tight global energy markets and high fuel prices have led big energy consumer nations like the United States to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term-reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security, 22.

                            9. What is meant by 'one planet living'?
a. reducing expenses in order to efficiently manage human population growth
b. engaging in more global markets to increase customer data and profitability
c. adjusting resource usage so as not to use more resources than are renewable
d. consuming resources that benefit growing markets and address social issues</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>One planet living</strong> is simply <strong>adjusting resource usage</strong></p><p></p><p>In sum, <strong>one planet living</strong> is a vision where humans will have to use natural resources that are available in mother earth. As one may know, with each passing day and with each usage of natural renewable or non renewable resource, some day there will be resource scarcity or even complete disappearance of it. </p><p></p><p>Thus, the goal of<strong> one planet living</strong> is to make use of the resources available in this planet with great attention and realization that it will disappear some day. Every person living on the earth can take any action that will benefit this vision. Most of the times, small act that we do towards preserving the environment will also count. </p><p></p>In addition, here is the explanation of each choice in the original question:<p></p><p>a. Reducing expenses to manage population growth is not the definition of <strong>one planet living</strong>. This is, instead, heavily tied with efficiency in budgeting and economy. In addition, more population means more usage of natural resources, which would contribute in a faster rate of resource declining.</p><p></p><p>b. This definition is closely related to profit-seeking rather than environment-driven statement. Average business model would benefit from this statement, however, there is no correlation to '<strong>one planet living'</strong> as a vision.</p><p></p><p>c. Adjusting resource usage aligns with the goal of<strong> 'one planet living'</strong> as a vision. Adjustments in using resources will result in efficiency of its usage, so the already available resources would not decrease faster than it already is.</p><p></p><p>d. Lastly, resources usage whose end goal is to benefit the human themselves (markets and social issues) is not what is meant with <strong>'one planet living'</strong>, as this statement is more focused on consuming and benefiting for the humans, not resources-driven.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> one planet living</strong> by clicking this link: https://brainly.ph/question/20026505</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            12. Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</h2><br />
                        <strong>The Negative Impact of Global Free Trade </strong><p>Now that international or foreign brands may enter and exit the country so easily as a result of global free trade, we tend to have easier access to them (through online shopping). As a result of the high demand for international goods, citizens may eventually start to <strong>disregard</strong> the nation's own local products and economy.</p><p></p><p>Global free trade is taking place between various nations or jurisdictions where there are no limits or limitations on the import or export of commodities, resources, information, services, and technology, including taxes, prohibitions, and quotas. </p><p></p><p>Free trade may benefit our economy, but it frequently threatens its stability and causes harm, particularly to <strong>workers.</strong> This could reduce market competition and result in lower local demand for goods and services. Free trade may increase economic output and expand market opportunities. All the goods and services that are being traded can be had for less money. We choose to purchase items or services that are inexpensive, which is bad for local businesses and workers. These could lead to wage stagnation, declining demand, rising unemployment, and underpaid labor, which would negate the advantages of this global free trade.</p><p></p><p>According to this<strong> viewpoint,</strong> global free trade benefits more businesses, but for the poor, it poses a threat to their way of life and may have detrimental effects on other local employees and marketplaces.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about market here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/17316809#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

The globalization of the world economy is also having a positive impact on the volume of FDI. 10).During the 1980s and 1990s, the United States was often the favorite target for FDI inflows.11). Exporting involves producing goods at home and then shipping them to the receiving country for sale. 12). Licensing involves granting a foreign entity (the licensee) the right to produce and sell the firm’s product in return for a royalty fee on every unit sold. 13). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expensive because a firm must bear the costs of establishing production facilities in a foreign country or of acquiring a foreign enterprise. 14). when a firm allows another enterprise to produce its products under license, the license bear costs or risks. 15). The viability of an exporting strategy is often constrained by transportation costs and trade barriers. 16). By placing tariffs on imported goods, governments can increase the cost of exporting relative to foreign direct investment and licensing. 17). Licensing may result in a firm’s giving away valuable know- how to a potential foreign competitor. 18). Countries should specialize in the production of those goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. 19). The pragmatic nationalist view is that FDI has both benefits and costs. 20). When a foreign company rather than a domestic company produces products, the profits from that investment go abroad. ​</h2><br />

                            19. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if is specific.16. The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19. Since the Ukraine invasion began on February 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with at least 140 yes votes. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special military operation" to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 20. Despite decades of international climate negotiations, carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily, with current emissions projections putting 1.5 degrees C well out of reach. 21. Tight global energy markets and high fuel prices have led big energy consumer nations like the United States to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term-reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security, 22. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic human rights violations.​</h2><br />
