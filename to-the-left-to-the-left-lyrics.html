When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor.

In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</a>

1. I have died everyday              waiting for you
Darling don’t be afraid; I have loved you
For a thousand years, I’ll love you for a thousand more.
2. I have two hands, the left and the right Hold them up high, so clean, and bright 
Clap them softly, One, two, three
3. Shot me out of the sky, you are my kryptonite You keep making me weak
Frozen and can’t breathe
4. Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down
5. Like a small boat On the ocean Sending big waves into motion

                                            (guess the lyrics)
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion

I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song

My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
