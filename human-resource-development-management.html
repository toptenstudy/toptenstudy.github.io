HR can make employees happier and more productive by providing positive training and enjoyable work environments that help retain talent.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The role of the human resources department has expanded in the last few years to grow past simply enforcing policies and procedures, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and people management. HR leaders now find that they must ensure a positive employer brand, create initiatives that increase employee engagement and productivity, and establish relationships between the company and employees beyond just their tenure at the organization. Because HR has so much to do, improving existing employee engagement and productivity is not always given top priority.</p><p></p><p>Often, HR leaders are focused on attracting new talent by designing bonus programs to keep compensation up-to-date with current market trends, and focusing on training and recruiting programs. Beyond attracting talent, HR departments can help keep recruiting and hiring costs down by focusing on keeping current talent productive and providing programs that encourage both personal and professional growth.</p><p></p><br />
