"Juan Dela Cruz was a top-notch College student. He maintained a consistent good grade while actively serving as an SK Chairman in his community as well. He’d never touched drugs – until last year of his staying in college. 
During his first year at one of the prestigious University in Mandaluyong, Juan decided to join a fraternity. While he was pledging, he started drinking, using prescription drugs and having sexual intercourse with some members of the fraternity. An older member of the fraternity introduced him to smoking and using drugs, he was deep into addiction. 
Imagine that you are one of a close friend to Juan. 
What will you do to help Juan?"</a>

My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset. I have heard that there are strange creatures coming out at night in this forest.” “Really?” Answered Pedro. “If that is the case, we 6.)_____ go back before four o’clock. By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</a>

After walking for three hours, Pedro said, “I am so tired 1.) _____ we sit for a few minutes? My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset. I have heard that there are strange creatures coming out at night in this forest.” “Really?” Answered Pedro. “If that is the case, we 6.)_____ go back before four o’clock. By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</h2><br />
