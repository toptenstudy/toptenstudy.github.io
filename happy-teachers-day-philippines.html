3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference.
