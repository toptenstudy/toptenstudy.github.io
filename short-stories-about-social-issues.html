                            14. III.b. Write the letter of the correct answer on the blank provided before each number. 6. Formalist criticism focuses on the text itself. Which of the following is not included in critiquing the form of a particular short story? A. literary devices B. moral of the story C. elements of a short story D. figures of speech 7. Which of the following is not included in the analysis using the Marxist approach? A. author's style of writing using literary devices B. social classes that constitute the setting of the story (their importance and role to run the plot and in injecting ideas) C. author's message on the issue or problem whether stated directly through Characters or merely implied D. author's idea about the prevailing social issue like oppression 8. Reader response critics are not interested in a "correct" interpretation of a text or what the author intended. They are interested in A. political and historical background of the story B. reader's individual experience while or after reading a text. C. inequality of gender issues raised D. the ethics and morals the story gives 9. Padre Damaso, a Franciscan Spanish priest supposed to be the personification of Christianism had committed abuses such as ordering the exhumation and transfer of Don Rafael's body to the Chinese cemetery. In the later part of the novel, it was revealed that he abused Dona Pia Alba, making him the father of Maria Clara. What approach will you use to develop a literary criticism for these details? A. Historical B. Marxist 10. Criticism that places literature in a social context and attempts to understand representation from a woman's point of view is called A. Marxist B. Reader-response C. Moralist D. Formalist C. Feminist D. Moralist​</h2><br />
                        <p>6 B</p><p>7 A</p><p>8 B</p><p>9 A</p><p>10 C</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>6) The answer is B, moral of the story. Formalist criticism is concerned with analyzing the form of a work of literature, such as the literary devices used and the elements of a short story, to better understand the meaning and impact of the text. The moral of the story, however, is not a formal aspect of the text, but rather a thematic one.</p><p></p><p>7) The answer is A, author's style of writing using literary devices. Marxist criticism focuses on the ways in which literature reflects and reinforces social and economic inequality, particularly in terms of social class. This approach analyzes the social classes portrayed in the story, the author's message about social issues, and the role of these issues in shaping the plot and themes of the text. The author's style of writing is not typically of interest to Marxist critics.</p><p></p><p>8) The answer is B, reader's individual experience while or after reading a text. Reader-response criticism is concerned with how readers interpret and respond to a text, and the ways in which their personal experiences, biases, and cultural backgrounds influence this interpretation. This approach is less concerned with a "correct" interpretation of the text or the author's intentions, and more focused on understanding how different readers might respond to the same text in different ways.</p><p></p><p>9) The answer is A, historical. Historical criticism is concerned with understanding a text within the context of its historical period, including the social, cultural, and political factors that may have influenced its creation and reception. In the case of Padre Damaso's character in Jose Rizal's "Noli Me Tangere," historical criticism could be used to examine the historical context of the novel's setting and the role of the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines at the time.</p><p></p><p>10) The answer is C, feminist. Feminist criticism is concerned with analyzing literature from a gendered perspective, particularly with regard to the ways in which women are represented and how gender roles and power dynamics are depicted in the text. This approach often seeks to uncover and challenge patriarchal assumptions and biases in literature, and to highlight the experiences and perspectives of women in the text.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
