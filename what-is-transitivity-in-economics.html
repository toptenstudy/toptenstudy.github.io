                                            The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</a>

                                            True or False.1. Modular jack cable is used for telephone systems, data networks, and low-speed serial connections.2. There are 6 wires to secure inside the modular jack.3. Punch down tool is use to secure each wire to the slot of modular jack cable.4. The modular jack consist of A and B configurations.5. LAN tester is use to check the connectivity of modular jack cable.6. 5s hepls facilities prevent lost efficiency from disrupted work or unplanned downtime by offering a systematic structure for organization and cleanliness.7. Sort, or 'seiton,' which translates to 'tidiness', is the first phase in the 5s method. The aim of the sort step is to remove clutter and clean up room by eliminating items that do not belong in the place.8. Take a close look at the objects, equipment, and materials in a working area for this move. Things that are required or useful in that room for the work being done should be kept there.9. Initially, the second step , Set in Order, was called "seiri", which translate to "orderlines". In english for example, a variety of names were used: " Systematic Arrangement", " Straightening out", and "simplify".10. Standardize, or 'seiketsu', is the fourth level, which simply means standardization. You will integrate the latest methods into standard work processes by writing down what is being done, when and by whom. It paves the way for long term transformation.11. Hazardous waste are substances that are without any sage commercial, industrial, agricultural, or economic usage and are shipped, transported, or brought from the country of origin for dumping or disposal into or in transit through any part of the territory of the philippines.12. As technology for commercial, industrial, household and appliances are evolving on a global scale, the amount of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) and hazardous substances generated from the source materials involved in manufacturing and usage are increasing.13. Because of the rising market penetration in developing countries, replacement market in developed countries, and high obsolenscence rate, WEEE is one of the fastest streams in the world.14. WEE treatment should prevent the dispersion of contaminants, inclusing sanitary landfills, in the waste stream15. In accordance with DAO 2013-25, no hazardous wastes from the components of WEEE shall be stored, recycled, treated, and disposed of in facilities other than those facilities permitted by DENR.

MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

                            6. The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</h2><br />

                            8. DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.
