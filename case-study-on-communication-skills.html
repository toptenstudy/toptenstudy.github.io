Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />
