                                            Directions: Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. The Influence of Video Games to Children Video games have been a part of children's life for the past few decades. It all started when Atari came up with its first gaming consul, which included a very simple game of tennis. The controller had just 1 stick and 1 button to play with. Now, we have many different types of consuls available in the market with very complex games that requires controllers with two or more sticks and a variety of buttons. Video games are almost second nature to the modern children and they are more comfortable playing them. Playing video games can have many different effects (both positive as well as negative) on children. Some of this effects include increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest in other interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence. One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child and improving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that are coming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds of sticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to make the fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. This allows them to think quickly and improves their re The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and movements for the children to control the characters. This helps in making th much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives. 2/4 Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addicted to playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from their other responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities. Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens than playing real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many health related problems for children, as they can get obese if. they don't exercise ad stay home playing video games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children. Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they are urging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video games consuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actually get up and move. Many researchers have talked about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how it affects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actually participating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allow children to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, and commit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on the children as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it is alright. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven or disproven as of yet. We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as well as negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving their reflexes, the cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as their becoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educators take up this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children to divide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies and other responsibilities.

This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                        QUESTION<p>How important are rules in playing a sports? Explain briefly, use 30 to 55 sentence.</p><p></p>ANSWER:<p>Disclaimer: I can't guarantee that my answer has 30-55 sentences, but it can contribute some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Rules play a critical role in sports as they ensure that the game is played fairly and safely for all participants. Here are some of the reasons why rules are important in playing sports:</p><strong>Fair play</strong>: Rules establish a level playing field for all participants, regardless of skill level or physical ability. This allows for fair competition and ensures that the outcome of the game is based on skill and strategy rather than on unfair advantages.<strong>Safety</strong>: Rules are also designed to ensure the safety of all participants. They outline what is considered acceptable behavior and establish penalties for dangerous or aggressive behavior. This helps to minimize the risk of injury and keeps the game safe for everyone involved.<strong>Consistency</strong>: Rules help to establish a consistent set of expectations for all participants. This consistency ensures that everyone knows what is expected of them and what they can expect from others. It also ensures that games can be played in different locations with different participants, while maintaining the same basic structure and fairness.<strong>Respect</strong>: Following the rules is a sign of respect for the game, the other players, and the officials. It shows a willingness to play fairly and to accept the authority of the officials who enforce the rules. This respect helps to create a positive and sportsmanlike atmosphere among all participants.<strong>Development of skills</strong>: Rules can also help to develop the skills of the players. For example, in basketball, the rules of the game require players to pass the ball, which helps to develop teamwork and passing skills. This focus on skill development helps to create better players and a better game overall.<p>In summary, rules are an essential part of playing sports. They ensure fair play, safety, consistency, respect, and skill development, all of which contribute to a positive and enjoyable experience for all participants.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p><strong>50 SENTENCE</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Rules are essential in playing a sport. They provide structure and ensure that the game is fair and safe for all players. Rules also help to maintain the integrity of the sport by providing guidelines for how it should be played. Without rules, sports would be chaotic and potentially dangerous.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Directions: Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. The Influence of Video Games to Children Video games have been a part of children's life for the past few decades. It all started when Atari came up with its first gaming consul, which included a very simple game of tennis. The controller had just 1 stick and 1 button to play with. Now, we have many different types of consuls available in the market with very complex games that requires controllers with two or more sticks and a variety of buttons. Video games are almost second nature to the modern children and they are more comfortable playing them. Playing video games can have many different effects (both positive as well as negative) on children. Some of this effects include increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest in other interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence. One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child and improving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that are coming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds of sticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to make the fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. This allows them to think quickly and improves their re The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and movements for the children to control the characters. This helps in making th much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives. 2/4 Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addicted to playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from their other responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities. Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens than playing real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many health related problems for children, as they can get obese if. they don't exercise ad stay home playing video games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children. Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they are urging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video games consuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actually get up and move. Many researchers have talked about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how it affects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actually participating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allow children to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, and commit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on the children as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it is alright. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven or disproven as of yet. We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as well as negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving their reflexes, the cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as their becoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educators take up this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children to divide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies and other responsibilities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Games and sports are very useful for students. They give good exercise to the body. Students generally do a lot of mental labor. They can become more active and study with more care and interest through games and sports.
</p><p>
</p><p>In this generation, students and office-goers live and work in a room. They constantly sit in one place which is not good for their health. Playing a little ensures proper growth of the body and makes them stay healthy and fit. Other than physical and mental fitness, sports and games have more benefits too. It makes us disciplined. We have to follow certain rules in all games and sports. Whether we like it or not, we have to follow. This makes a healthy impact on ever-growing indiscipline among the students today.
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>There is another advantage too. Games and sports develop a sense of co-operation and fellow feeling. While playing in a team, the players play like a single man. This promotes strength lies in unity.
</p><p>
</p><p>"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy", is a popular saying. But "All play and no work" is not good for anyone. We should not spend all our time in games. In fact, work and play must go hand in hand.</p><p></p><br />

As mentioned earlier, the new video games that arecoming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds ofsticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.
