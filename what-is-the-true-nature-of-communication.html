The expression uses the word "<strong>done</strong>" in the sense of "finished" or "settled", a usage which dates back to the first half of the 15th century. There is no rule against using done to mean finished. Upon the completion of a meal for example, you are allowed to say "I'm <strong>done</strong>" or "I'm finished.". Being <strong>done</strong> to someone means they are over in any form of relationship or even communication. This also applied to the thing they have done in a particular situation where they cannot put it back. All they have to do is to move on and start again. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>You’re done. you’re done:</strong>
