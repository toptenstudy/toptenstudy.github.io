If Suzie wanted to jump rope, June wanted to play hopscotch. 11 June wanted to watch soap operas, Suzie wanted to watch talk shows. Tensions rose to the point that the girls could no longer stand one another's company. It seemed that they had nothing in common, until the day that progress reports went home. On the bus the girls were started by how upset the other looked. They realized that they were both failing a subject. Suzie was failing math and June was failing reading, Since both girls wanted to pass their classes, they agreed to help one another. So after school for the next few weeks, Suzie tutored June in reading and then June tutored Suzie in math. By the time report cards were distributed, Suzie and June were passing all their classes. The girls were delighted, but their mother was happiest of all. Not just because her daughters had passed their classes, but because they learned to be good sisters. y It n e What is the theme of this story? 2.

Based on what you learned in your English class, encircle the subject and underline the object in this sentence. Mary Rose threw the ball.2, In English, what is the difference between a Subject and an Object? Analyze this story and answer the questions that follow. Mr. Libangan is the Principal of Divine Temple Academy.  He has a problem with one of the teachers, Mrs. Javier.   Mrs. Javier is already 58 years old.  The retirement age for teachers is 60 so she can still teach for two more years.  For the past 25 years, she had been a model teacher who prepared excellent lessons, managed the class well and was very much loved by the students and her co-teachers.  But lately, Mrs. Javier’s age and health seem to be affecting her teaching.  She attends training but she cannot learn how to use technology in her class.  She still uses cartolina while all other teachers use laptops and E-tablets.  Her class gets bored.  She is also very forgetful lately.  One time, she forgot the test papers of the students in the cafeteria.  She did not know that many students were able to get a copy so many students got perfect scores in the test.  In another time, she was found sleeping in the faculty room when it was actually time for her class.  And just recently, she brought home the report cards of her class but left them in the bus.  As a result, the students’ cards were not given during the card distribution day.  The parents of the students got very angry and went to Mr. Libangan, demanding that Mrs. Javier be dismissed.  Mr. Libangan knows that Mrs. Javier is sorry for her mistakes and that she is still trying her best to become a good teacher.  But Mr. Libangan also knows that if he still allows Mrs. Javier to teach for two more years, more problems will arise and more parents would protest against her and might even sue the school.3, If you were Mr. Libangan, what will you do?  Why?  4,Talk with your seatmates, share your answer then come up with the best solution you can suggest to Mr. Libangan.  Write your revised answer here: ​</a>

</p><p>7. systematic
</p><p>
</p><p>Step-by-step explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling Methods
</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling methods are the ways on selecting members from the population to be in the study. Researchers select samples rather than working with the overall population because most of the times, population involved in the study is large and it is impossible for them to gather the needed data for every object in the study. There are five ways to select a sample and they are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>Random Sampling
</p><p>In this method, everyone in the population has an equal chance to be chosen. It is like everyone's name is in a box and researchers draw out several names.
</p><p>
</p><p>Systematic Sampling
</p><p>In systematic, the list of elements in the study is "counted off". Meaning the members of the population are put in order and every nth member is selected to be in the sample.
</p><p>
</p><p>Convenience Sampling
</p><p>The readily available sample is used in the study. Researchers poll people as they walk by on the street.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sfratified Sampling
</p><p>For stratified, the population is split into groups, then from each group samples are selected.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cluster Sampling
</p><p>In this method, population is also split into groups. The difference from stratified is that samples in cluster consist of every member of the selected groups.

Suzie was failing math and June was failing reading, Since both girls wanted to pass their classes, they agreed to help one another. So after school for the next few weeks, Suzie tutored June in reading and then June tutored Suzie in math. By the time report cards were distributed, Suzie and June were passing all their classes. The girls were delighted, but their mother was happiest of all.

                            29. MAN AS AN EMBODIED SPIRIT AND A SUBJECT1, What is the difference between having an object and “having” your body? Based on what you learned in your English class, encircle the subject and underline the object in this sentence. Mary Rose threw the ball.2, In English, what is the difference between a Subject and an Object? Analyze this story and answer the questions that follow. Mr. Libangan is the Principal of Divine Temple Academy.  He has a problem with one of the teachers, Mrs. Javier.   Mrs. Javier is already 58 years old.  The retirement age for teachers is 60 so she can still teach for two more years.  For the past 25 years, she had been a model teacher who prepared excellent lessons, managed the class well and was very much loved by the students and her co-teachers.  But lately, Mrs. Javier’s age and health seem to be affecting her teaching.  She attends training but she cannot learn how to use technology in her class.  She still uses cartolina while all other teachers use laptops and E-tablets.  Her class gets bored.  She is also very forgetful lately.  One time, she forgot the test papers of the students in the cafeteria.  She did not know that many students were able to get a copy so many students got perfect scores in the test.  In another time, she was found sleeping in the faculty room when it was actually time for her class.  And just recently, she brought home the report cards of her class but left them in the bus.  As a result, the students’ cards were not given during the card distribution day.  The parents of the students got very angry and went to Mr. Libangan, demanding that Mrs. Javier be dismissed.  Mr. Libangan knows that Mrs. Javier is sorry for her mistakes and that she is still trying her best to become a good teacher.  But Mr. Libangan also knows that if he still allows Mrs. Javier to teach for two more years, more problems will arise and more parents would protest against her and might even sue the school.3, If you were Mr. Libangan, what will you do?  Why?  4,Talk with your seatmates, share your answer then come up with the best solution you can suggest to Mr. Libangan.  Write your revised answer here: ​</h2><br />
