                                            "give a title for this"Entrepreneurs are high-energy creative people, who are self-confident, have high levels of self-esteemand are futuristic in their outlook as theyseek to incessantly solve problems, take risks, and learn from failures(theirs and others). They thrive on change and have a natural predisposition to show initiative and willinglyaccept personal responsibility for projects. They harness all available resources within their scope in order toachieve success on their own terms.Successful entrepreneurs learn to control and discipline their gift and by combining this with a businesseducation (both formal and from the “school of hard knocks”) together with a perseverance and an enjoyment ofhard work. Driven by a righteous passion, they eventually craft their success in spite of the many precedingdisappointments and setbacks.Many people have tried unsuccessfully to categorize the entrepreneur, with the Webster's dictionarydescribing them as "one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” This is atypical researcher's description, written without the privileged insight into the mind and spirit of what makes anentrepreneur tick.Entrepreneurial skill-set would afford success in many fields of human endeavor; however, theentrepreneur is drawn to the world of business and commerce. This is because their great desire forindependence, their love of a competitive environment, the business world's reward for objectivity oversubjectivity, and the fact that excelling at this core societal realm makes the greatest use of their talent.However, sharing this “money accumulating" space in society are other players, with some like thescammers and value takers, whose view of success is so focused on just the money that they are quite prepared,if necessary, to sell both their integrity and their grandmother in order to have it. As you will see, while boththis particular acumen and the entrepreneur's methodology share the same "money accumulating' outcome,each achieves it with an entirely different mindset and approach. Entrepreneurs "make money," meaning theycreate value that did not previously exist rather than just accumulating money via schemes and exploitingweaknesses that take from another's hard-earned assets.​</a>

The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades.

Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat.

Here. dopamine functions to elicit feelings of pleasure or euphoria. What's more. it motivates an individual to proactively repeat any action that onginally fucled its production. In the case of sugar and fat, purported addiction is a consequence of the body raving the release of dopamine inherent in consumption (4) To validate reports that fat and sugar bchavc in A drug-like fashion researchers have conducted laboratory studios demonstrating that they induce classic addictive symptoms. For example, eliminating sugar from the nutritiona regime of rats that are used to a primarily sweet diet produced anxiety asymptomatic of heroin and nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, increased tolerance to addictive food substances was noted. In one experiment, rates were fed chocolate drink containing a high ratio of both fat and sugar.

Have you evewondered what happens in your stomach when you eat? A series of processes starts when you feel hungry and you get the urge to sate your hunger. The process starts when you get food and your brain commands, your muscle to pick, it up and put it in your mouth. Inside the mouth, food will be blended with saliva and broken down into smaller pieces through the chewing motions of your teeth. Once youswallow the food, it will pass through your esophagus. It will then move to your stomach, where gastric juices will be released to digest carbohydrates and proteins. The semi-digested food is then transported to the duodenum and then to the jejunum, ileum, and liver for further absorption. All of these processes constitute the digestion process.Implied main idea:__________________________________________________. 2. According to National Geographic, global warming may have catastrophic effects. One of these consequences is the melting of polar caps at an alarming rate - an even which poses a danger to low-lying areas across continents. In fact, the polar caps are melting at a dangerous speed that the Glacier National Park in the United States will be gone by 2070 if this keeps up. Aside from this, global warming also causes severe heat waves in North America. According to reports, at least 225 people had died due to heat waves. An erratic weather pattern is another undesirable effect of global warming, summers become hotter and winters become colder. Hurricanes or typhoons are also becoming more and more intense. If we will not do something today, our children's children will inevitably face the consequences.Implied main idea:__________________________________________________.3.

                            6. "give a title for this"Entrepreneurs are high-energy creative people, who are self-confident, have high levels of self-esteemand are futuristic in their outlook as theyseek to incessantly solve problems, take risks, and learn from failures(theirs and others). They thrive on change and have a natural predisposition to show initiative and willinglyaccept personal responsibility for projects. They harness all available resources within their scope in order toachieve success on their own terms.Successful entrepreneurs learn to control and discipline their gift and by combining this with a businesseducation (both formal and from the “school of hard knocks”) together with a perseverance and an enjoyment ofhard work. Driven by a righteous passion, they eventually craft their success in spite of the many precedingdisappointments and setbacks.Many people have tried unsuccessfully to categorize the entrepreneur, with the Webster's dictionarydescribing them as "one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” This is atypical researcher's description, written without the privileged insight into the mind and spirit of what makes anentrepreneur tick.Entrepreneurial skill-set would afford success in many fields of human endeavor; however, theentrepreneur is drawn to the world of business and commerce. This is because their great desire forindependence, their love of a competitive environment, the business world's reward for objectivity oversubjectivity, and the fact that excelling at this core societal realm makes the greatest use of their talent.However, sharing this “money accumulating" space in society are other players, with some like thescammers and value takers, whose view of success is so focused on just the money that they are quite prepared,if necessary, to sell both their integrity and their grandmother in order to have it. As you will see, while boththis particular acumen and the entrepreneur's methodology share the same "money accumulating' outcome,each achieves it with an entirely different mindset and approach. Entrepreneurs "make money," meaning theycreate value that did not previously exist rather than just accumulating money via schemes and exploitingweaknesses that take from another's hard-earned assets.​</h2><br />

The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades. What may come as a shock. however, is the accumulation of evidence suggesting that the inain ingredients in the typical "hamburger, fries, and a cola are addictive compounds that their fix. lining keep next for customers up (2) The key culprits are sugar and far. Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat. Single-handedly. this meal sized portion meets the full daily caloric requirement for the average woman. Moreover, it exceeds the recommended daily allowances of both sugar and fat for any adult, regardless of gender (3) Whercas heroin opiate, both sugar and fat stimulate endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphins in the hypothalamus. just above the brain stem.

Here. dopamine functions to elicit feelings of pleasure or euphoria. What's more. it motivates an individual to proactively repeat any action that onginally fucled its production. In the case of sugar and fat, purported addiction is a consequence of the body raving the release of dopamine inherent in consumption (4) To validate reports that fat and sugar bchavc in A drug-like fashion researchers have conducted laboratory studios demonstrating that they induce classic addictive symptoms. For example, eliminating sugar from the nutritiona regime of rats that are used to a primarily sweet diet produced anxiety asymptomatic of heroin and nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, increased tolerance to addictive food substances was noted. In one experiment, rates were fed chocolate drink containing a high ratio of both fat and sugar. Although the animals were found to ingest increasing amounts of the potent liquid, their tota production of resulting brain opiates was, in fact, diminished.

Read the following paragraphs very carefully. Encircle the topic and underline the main idea of each paragraph. If the main idea is not present, write it on the space provided.1. Have you evewondered what happens in your stomach when you eat? A series of processes starts when you feel hungry and you get the urge to sate your hunger. The process starts when you get food and your brain commands, your muscle to pick, it up and put it in your mouth. Inside the mouth, food will be blended with saliva and broken down into smaller pieces through the chewing motions of your teeth. Once youswallow the food, it will pass through your esophagus. It will then move to your stomach, where gastric juices will be released to digest carbohydrates and proteins. The semi-digested food is then transported to the duodenum and then to the jejunum, ileum, and liver for further absorption. All of these processes constitute the digestion process.Implied main idea:__________________________________________________. 2. According to National Geographic, global warming may have catastrophic effects. One of these consequences is the melting of polar caps at an alarming rate - an even which poses a danger to low-lying areas across continents. In fact, the polar caps are melting at a dangerous speed that the Glacier National Park in the United States will be gone by 2070 if this keeps up. Aside from this, global warming also causes severe heat waves in North America. According to reports, at least 225 people had died due to heat waves. An erratic weather pattern is another undesirable effect of global warming, summers become hotter and winters become colder. Hurricanes or typhoons are also becoming more and more intense. If we will not do something today, our children's children will inevitably face the consequences.Implied main idea:__________________________________________________.3. Are you tired of being an employee? Do you want to have a more flexible time instead of an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. job? Do you want to practice your business acumen? If your answer to these questions is yes, then it is time for you to start your own small business. The first thing you have to do is to research and define your target market. After that, you have to come up with a business plan. It does not need to be an elaborate and formal plan: you just have to include the essential information such as your vision and mission, marketing strategies, financial capital, and forecasted income and expenses. acquire the necessary financial, technical, in human resource capital in the assemble your team. once you have, register your business and set up your accounting system, and then execute your marketing plan.Implied main idea:__________________________________________________.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Acerbic and acerb ultimately come from the Latin adjective acerbus, which can mean "harsh" or "unpleasant." Another English word that comes from acerbus is exacerbate, which means "to make more violent or severe."</p><p>6.The word photography derives from the Greek photos ("light") and graphe ("drawing"). ... Photos is also the root of words such as photon or photophobia (fear of light).</p><p>2.To capitulate is to surrender outright or to give in under certain terms. Either way, you're agreeing to something you don't really want. The word comes from the Latin roots caput ("head") and capitulum ("headings"), a reference to the official agreement drawn up when someone formally surrendered.</p><p>7.1600, "having sound judgment; careful, prudent," also "manifesting sound judgment, carefully planned," from French judicieux (16c.) or directly from Medieval Latin iudiciosus "prudent, judicious," from Latin iudicium "judgment," from iudicem "a judge" (see judge (n.)).</p><p>3.The word root 'chron' means time, and it came from the Greek word khronos 'time'. Thus, all words with this word root revolve around time. Let's have a look at the word chronic that is used to describe something lasting for a long time as in chronic drinker or chronic pain.</p><p>8.The word demography comes from two ancient Greek words, demos, meaning "the people," and graphy, meaning "writing about or recording something" — so literally demography means "writing about the people." Like many branches of the sciences, demography began in the 19th century, when the general craze for cataloging ...</p><p>4.alter, amend, adjust, change the properties, form, or function of;" also "set limits, keep within the bounds of reason; choose a middle course," from Old French modifier (14c.), from Latin modificare "to limit, measure off, restrain," from modus "measure, manner" (from PIE root *med- "take appropriate measures") + combining form of facere "to make" (from PIE root *dhe- "to set, put")</p><p>9.frat Add to list Share. ... The word frat is short for fraternity, and both words mean "body of men associated by common interest," from the Latin root fraternitatem, or "brotherhood." A frat will usually have their own house and a name made up of two or three Greek letters.</p><p>5.The noun acumen comes from the Latin word acumen, meaning “a point,” or “sting.” If you are able to make pointed decisions, if you have a sharp intellect, if you make good strategic moves, if you are successful in your field, or if your business instincts are spot-on, you have acumen.</p><p>10.formerly also enduce, late 14c., "to lead by persuasions or other influences," from Latin inducere "lead into, bring in, introduce, conduct; persuade; suppose, imagine," from in- "into, in, on, upon" (from PIE root *en "in") + ducere "to lead" (from PIE root *deuk- "to lead").</p><p></p><p> yan po lng po ang na i search ko☺️ hope ko naka help kahit konti❤️</p><p></p><br />
