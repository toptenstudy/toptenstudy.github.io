"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poor Reading Comprehension of Young Filipinos: Causes and Solutions</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Reading is an essential skill that is critical to a child's academic success and personal growth. Unfortunately, many young Filipinos are struggling with poor reading comprehension skills. Despite the availability of resources, such as books and educational programs, the reading skills of Filipino students remain subpar. This essay explores the causes of poor reading comprehension skills among young Filipinos and offers solutions to address this pressing issue.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary causes of poor reading comprehension skills is the lack of reading materials at home. Many Filipino families do not have access to books, and those who do often cannot afford to buy them. Additionally, some households do not prioritize reading, as they consider it a leisure activity rather than an essential skill. As a result, children are not exposed to reading materials and are not motivated to read.</p><p></p><p>Another factor is the quality of education in the Philippines. Like me, I don't even know how to make my own essay. Schools may not have enough resources to provide students with the necessary reading materials, such as books and library resources. Teachers may not have the proper training and expertise to teach reading comprehension effectively. Students may also face difficulties with the English language, which is the primary medium of instruction in the country.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, technology has also contributed to the problem of poor reading comprehension. The rise of gadgets and social media has led to distractions and shortened attention spans, making it challenging for young people to focus on reading. Some students prefer watching videos or playing games, which do not require the same level of attention and focus as reading.</p><p></p><p>To address the issue of poor reading comprehension skills among young Filipinos, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, the government should invest in providing more reading materials in schools and public libraries. This can be done by allocating more funds for the purchase of books and other resources. Additionally, the government can launch reading programs that encourage children to read and promote literacy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, parents should also play an active role in promoting reading at home. They can provide their children with books or take them to the library. They can also encourage their children to read by setting aside time for reading and making it a regular habit.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, educators should improve their teaching methods to make reading comprehension more engaging and interactive. Teachers can use technology to enhance reading materials, such as using e-books and interactive platforms to make reading more enjoyable for students. They can also provide activities that encourage critical thinking and analysis of the text.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poor reading comprehension skills among young Filipinos have many causes, such as the lack of reading materials, inadequate education, and technology. However, solutions such as providing more reading materials in schools and libraries, promoting reading at home, and improving teaching methods can help address this issue. By nurturing reading comprehension skills, young Filipinos can unlock a world of knowledge and opportunities that can help them succeed in school and beyond.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 f you live with anxiety, you know that it can show up unannounced and sometimes for reasons that don’t even make sense to you. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, your anxiety levels might be higher than usual, or maybe you’ve been feeling near-constant underlying anxiety. You aren’t alone – uncertainty is a common trigger for many, and the past year has been anything but certain. As we start to get toward the other side of this pandemic, a new anxiety has surfaced for many: getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Here we’ll try to alleviate some of the most common causes of vaccine-related anxiety.<br />2 In a 2018 global survey called Program for International Assessment (PISA) among 600,000 students worldwide, Filipino students around the age of 15 got a rating of 340 points in reading comprehension, lower than the average of 487 points. Consequently, in the said study, the Philippines ranked last among 79 countries.<br /></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

And to solve this problem, the steps for a comprehensive plan of action are :</p><strong>Identifying Issues:</strong> The issue to be identified is the growth in the use of motorized vehicles which creates traffic congestion.<strong>Status Goals: </strong>The goal is to minimize congestion as a result of the growth in the use of motorized vehicles<strong>Collecting Data: </strong>The data that is trying to be collected is data on the number of cars and population data in the community<strong>Preparing The Plan : </strong>Based on the data received, an analysis will be carried out on the preparation of the plan where the fact is that in one house there are people who own and use more than one car. So the right plan to overcome this problem is to provide facilities in the form of public transportation.<strong>Creating Implementaion Plans :</strong> Implementation of plans for the provision of public transportation in the form of accurate distribution with long route coverage, adequate facilities with good quality, and volume of public transportation facilities.<strong>Evaluating Alternatives :</strong> With adequate public transportation facilities, an evaluation related to prices is also needed, this requires adjustments so that people remain consumers and managers still get management operational costs.<strong>Implementing and Monitoring the Plan :</strong> After all the required aspects have been completed, the plans that have been prepared can be implemented in the community and gradual monitoring is carried out to evaluate each obstacle. So with the formation of a system that becomes a forum for the availability of public transportation in the community, it will reduce the number of car use so that traffic jams will be more unraveled.<p></p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>Comprehensive mental health action plan https://brainly.ph/question/15663869 </p><p>#SPJ1 </p><p></p><br />

</p><p>In May 2013, the 66th World Health Assembly adopted the “Mental health action plan for 2013–2020”. This action plan was extended to 2030 at the 72nd World Health Assembly to ensure its alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The plan will help countries achieve Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4 – by 2030, reduce by one third premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment, and promote mental health and well-being.
</p><p>
</p><p>The action plan was developed in response to the growing burden of mental health disorders and the challenges that health systems around the world are facing to respond to the needs of people with mental health problems. The action plan is a landmark achievement that focuses international attention on a long-neglected problem and is firmly rooted in the principles of human rights.</p><p></p><br />

                        What are the reasons for poor reading comprehension? ​Poor Reading Comprehension Skills Lead to Poor Grades
<p><strong>When kids don’t understand what they read, it affects their ability to succeed in school.  All subjects, including science and math, require reading comprehension. Even Tests and exams require good reading comprehension which results in low grades and poor test scores if a student has poor reading comprehension.</strong>
</p><p>
</p> Signs of Poor Reading Comprehension
<p><strong>Can’t answer questions about what they just read
</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t understand the logical sequence of a story
</strong></p><p><strong>Unable to tell the story after reading it
</strong></p><p><strong>Can’t connect individual sentences or paragraphs of text together to make sense of what they’ve read.
</strong></p><p><strong>Doesn’t know the meaning of individual words
</strong></p><p><strong>Loses interest in reading or give up quickly</strong>
</p><p></p>What Causes Poor Reading Comprehension
<p></p><p><strong>Disinterest and boredom causes children not to pay attention to what they’re reading. Some bright children find the story or material they’re reading so simple that they’re bored. Others are disinterested in what they’re reading because it doesn’t relate to anything they care or know about.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Decoding individual words slows down or prevents reading comprehension. If the assigned material includes too many words a child doesn’t know, they’ll focus on decoding rather than understanding. Many will simply give up trying to read what’s assigned. ESL children and kids from families who don’t engage their children in conversation and have few books will often not understand words that other kids in their class know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Difficult text challenges some students. For others, it’s so frustrating they give up. A story may be appropriate for the grade level of the child but too hard for an individual children. In addition to not knowing the vocabulary, the context can be unfamiliar or the story too complex.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Oral language deficit is often associated with poor reading comprehension. Children with limited vocabulary and oral reading fluency will have difficulties understanding written text. Recent research has shown that “spoken language training seems to have resulted in a generalized improvement in the kids’ ability to understand language.”
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Working memory deficit occurs with kids who can’t remember what they’ve read long enough to talk about it or explain the story immediately after reading. It’s common with kids with ADHD,</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Visual processing disorder affects students’ reading comprehension if they skip words or lines. They may also be unable to judge depth and distance and reverse letters and numbers. Children with visual perception problems usually have poor eye-hand coordination. Visual processing disorder can affect not only reading comprehension but math and motor skills.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Poor memory skills affect all of learning including reading comprehension. Researchers at Vanderbilt University have recently been investigating Specific Reading Comprehension Deficits or S-RCD.  They’ve discovered from brain scans that kids with dyslexia have abnormalities in a different part of the brain than kids who have poor reading comprehension.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Executive Function Disorder (EFD) involves being able to plan, organize, makes changes, and complete a task. ADHD kids often have poor executive functioning. Kids with EFD will have trouble figuring out the organization of a story and the time line. They often give up and don’t complete a reading assignment if they think it’s too hard. Since their self-monitoring skills are poor, they have trouble figuring out strategies to help with reading comprehension. These include sounding out a  word they don’t know, asking the teacher for help,  looking the word up in a dictionary, and reading a little bit more to see if they can figure out the word from the context.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Limited vocabulary can cause poor reading comprehension. If children don’t know the meaning of the words they’re reading, they’ll miss the meaning of the story or chapter. Many won’t bother trying to decode the unknown words, especially if they find lots of words they don’t know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Aphasia and dysphasia, which are caused by  brain injury, tumor, or a virus, can cause difficulties in reading comprehension. These children will also have speech problems. If common strategies used by a teacher or reading specialist don’t help, testing by a neurologist and speech therapist is recommended.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>ADHD kids have difficulty concentrating on a task including reading. When they can’t focus, they won’t understand what they read. The problem isn’t as much a reading challenge as an inability to sit still and focus long enough to finish a story.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Hope this helps :)</strong><p><strong></strong></p><br />

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</h2><br />

Some of the research findings based on the conclusion are:</p><p>•	Students in the Philippines need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalized economy.</p><p>•	Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them.</p><p>•	The level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science among first-year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines is poor.</p><p>•	Students seem to be struggling with both the content of science and the skills needed to be a proficient reader.</p><p>•	There is a significant positive correlation between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, but such relationship is negligible.</p><p>•	Poor performance in science among Filipino students is contributing to the bad image of Philippine education both locally and abroad, and this can be explained by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can't say yes, but definitely can't say no, </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Filipino kids in high school who still cannot read. While Philippines have a high literacy rate, 50% of kids do not know or understand what they are reading.</p><p>There are a lot of children in grade school who still do not even know the alphabet or know how to count. These are things learned in kindergarten but up until Grade 7, many are still unfamiliar with their ABCs.</p><p>Many of these low performing kids are raised by absentee parents who are not even aware their kids cannot read.</p><p>After school, the parents do not tutor them. They are usually not even at home.</p><p>The children spend a few hours after school working and earning to help their family. In the clip, the child filters through the garbage and sorts them out. He is paid ₱80 for a few hours work.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
