A language’s secondary purpose is to convey someone’s sentiments, emotions, or attitudes. English is one such language in the world that satisfies both the above purposes. English has been regarded as the first global Lingua Franca. It has become part and parcel of almost every existing field. We use it as the international language to communicate in many fields ranging from business to entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Many countries teach and encourage youngsters to acquire English as a second language.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Example of a Stressful Incident and Its Stages of Stress Response</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, I had a major project due for one of my courses in college. I had spent weeks researching and writing the paper, but as the deadline approached, I began to feel overwhelmed and anxious. On the day the paper was due, my computer crashed, and I lost all my progress. This incident triggered the three stages of the stress response: the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage.</p><p></p><p>The alarm stage is the first stage of the stress response. It is also known as the fight or flight response. When I realized that I had lost all my progress on the paper, my body went into a state of shock. My heart rate increased, and I began to sweat. My brain released hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepared me to either fight the problem or run away from it.</p><p></p><p>The resistance stage is the second stage of the stress response. It occurs when the stressor persists, and the body continues to respond to it. In my case, I had to decide what to do next. I could either give up on the project or start over. I chose to start over, which meant working long hours and sacrificing sleep and other activities. This stage is characterized by continued release of stress hormones, which can lead to physical and mental exhaustion if prolonged.</p><p></p><p>The exhaustion stage is the third and final stage of the stress response. It occurs when the body can no longer cope with the stressor, and it begins to break down. In my case, after weeks of stress and anxiety, I finally completed the project. However, I was physically and mentally exhausted. I had trouble sleeping, and I experienced headaches and other physical symptoms. This stage can lead to long-term health problems if not managed properly.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the three stages of the stress response – alarm, resistance, and exhaustion – are a natural and normal response to stressful situations. However, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to physical and mental health problems. In my case, the stress of the project caused me to experience physical symptoms and exhaustion. It is important to be aware of the stages of stress response and to take steps to manage stress effectively, such as through exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or mental health professionals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>note: follow and mark me Brainliest for more answers </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Congruent Triangles</p><p>Congruent triangles are triangles that have the same size and shape. This means that the corresponding sides are equal and the corresponding angles are equal.</p><p></p><p>We can tell whether two triangles are congruent without testing all the sides and all the angles of the two triangles. In this lesson, we will consider the four rules to prove triangle congruence. They are called the SSS rule, SAS rule, ASA rule and AAS rule. In another lesson, we will consider a proof used for right triangles called the Hypotenuse Leg rule.

Here are some questions that regularly plague my mind:</p><p></p><p>How do we know if space is truly infinite?</p><p>If it’s not, what’s outside of it?</p><p>Where did space come from?</p><p>I have had some people say that “Space was created by God”.</p><p></p><p>Well, then I raise you this:</p><p></p><p>Where did God come from?</p><p>How do we know God is real?</p><p>What is God?</p><p>To that last question, I have received one answer that I actually like.</p><p></p><p>“God is all things, all life. In a way, that means that God is everything, and that everything is God.

                        <p>Electricity is a controllable and convenient form of energy, a phenomenon that is the result of the existence of electrical charge. Electricity is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. It is the energy that is linked with magnetism. It is generated in power stations and sent across the country along with cables carried on towers called pylons.</p><p></p><p>Electricity is a necessity to modern civilization. It has invaded our lives and become vital in all aspects to our society. It is a medium for the transmission of signals in computers, cell phones etc. In industry, manufacturing relies on electricity to drive virtually all moving parts and can be converted into light, heat and magnetism. Scientific inventions like portable batteries and memory sticks have made the world worth living. Diseases are cured by electric treatment. The electric printing press has given us newspapers, magazines and books bringing light not only to our homes but also to our heads.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure safety in and out of our homes, be sure to turn off the lights and unplug all electrical appliances like TV, computers etc because they have stand by functions that consume electricity even when turned off. Be careful not to leave electrical cords where people might step on them. Be away from areas marked with signs that read "Danger: High Voltage." Avoid excessive illumination and never use water to put out an electrical fire, never climb utility poles and fences around electrical plants. Always put away electrical appliances and power tools immediately after use. </p><p> </p><p>      </p><p></p><p></p><br />

According to this theory, the universe is billions of years old and was formed through a process known as the Big Bang, which occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago.</p><p></p><p>Another widely accepted scientific theory is the theory of relativity, which proposes that the fundamental nature of space and time is relative and that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This theory has been supported by a wealth of empirical evidence and has had a significant impact on our understanding of the nature of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the nature of the world, there are many philosophical and religious beliefs about the nature of reality and the purpose of life. Some people believe that the world is governed by a higher power or a set of universal laws, while others believe that the world is governed by chance or randomness. There are also many different beliefs about the nature of consciousness and the existence of an afterlife.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the nature of the world and the universe is a complex and multifaceted question that has been explored by scientists, philosophers, and theologians for centuries. While we have made great strides in understanding these concepts, there is still much that we do not know and much that remains a mystery.</p><br />

1. What are your personal ideas about the nature of the world and the universe?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>One way to approach this question is to consider the different ways that people have attempted to understand the world and the universe throughout history. One of the earliest and most influential perspectives comes from ancient Greek philosophers such as Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who proposed that the world was made up of fundamental elements such as water, air, or fire. This idea was later developed by Aristotle, who believed in a hierarchy of natural forms and a geocentric universe with Earth at the center.</p><p></p><p>In the modern era, scientific inquiry has led to a much more complex and nuanced understanding of the world and the universe. The most widely accepted scientific theory is the Big Bang theory, which explains the origins and evolution of the universe from a single point of singularity. This theory is supported by a wealth of evidence from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the large-scale structure of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The world we inhabit is a product of complex biological and geological processes that have been shaped by natural selection and other evolutionary mechanisms. Life on Earth has undergone several mass extinctions, and the current era is marked by human domination of the planet and its resources.</p><p></p><p>From a philosophical perspective, the nature of the world and the universe is a subject of ongoing debate and inquiry. Some philosophers argue that the world is fundamentally material and can be reduced to its physical components, while others emphasize the subjective and interpretive nature of human experience.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the nature of the world and the universe is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been approached from many different angles throughout history. While scientific inquiry has provided us with a great deal of knowledge about the origins and evolution of the universe, there is still much that remains mysterious and unknown. Philosophers continue to grapple with fundamental questions about the nature of reality and human experience, and our understanding of the world is likely to continue to evolve and change as we gain new insights and perspectives.</p><br />
