Scientists say the threat of a major eruption remains high because PHIVOLCS has reported some 450 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours, as well as the emergence of fissures, and receding of the surrounding lake. The ongoing seismic activity suggests that magma is continuing to rise to the volcano's surface from deep within the Earth. 1. Sign/s of Impending Volcanic Eruption:​</a>

                            26. The volcano remains at level 4, the second-highest level on the country's volcano-alert system, which means a hazardous eruption could happen in hours or days. Scientists say the threat of a major eruption remains high because PHIVOLCS has reported some 450 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours, as well as the emergence of fissures, and receding of the surrounding lake. The ongoing seismic activity suggests that magma is continuing to rise to the volcano's surface from deep within the Earth. 1. Sign/s of Impending Volcanic Eruption:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The emergence of fissures, the receding of the surrounding lake, and the occurrence of a large number of volcanic earthquakes (in this case, 450 in the past 24 hours) are all signs of an impending volcanic eruption. These signs indicate that magma is continuing to rise to the surface of the volcano from deep within the Earth, and the threat of a hazardous eruption is high.</p><br />
