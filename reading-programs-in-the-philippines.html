Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times - with or without disasters. Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities. In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. "At the center of malnutrition's underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices." Parreño added. “And we don't have a structure curriculum addressing this," he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9. Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle. The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also and school-based supplementary feeding programs. pa help po​</a>

First e-sports college degree in the Philippines now in the works By Vince Ferreras, CNN Philippines Metro Manila — Online gaming might not be an after-school pastime anymore in the future as the first degree program in electronic sports (esports) in the country is being developed. The Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) and esports and gaming agency Tier One Entertainment collaborated to develop the curriculum of the four-year degree on Bachelor of Science in ESports. It will be offered this coming school year once approved by the Commission on Higher Education. “We will be passing the curriculum to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on March this year. If this goes well, we might have a full course available by 2020,” said Tier One Entertainment in a post on social media. The gaming agency’s chief executive officer Tryke Gutierrez said that the new degree program will have two tracks namely: game development and esports management. However, he did not disclose yet the subjects under the program. “The goal has always been to create more opportunities for gamers in Asia. If this curriculum gets approved, we won't just be providing post career opportunities for gaming, but we will have a new generation of graduates ready to work in the esports industry,” said Gutierrez in an online post.

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

Nutrition and the Philippines: ‘Nation at risk
MANILA, Philippines — “Under nutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.” 
Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters. 
Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.
In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. “At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.
Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.​</a>

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

Read and analyze the article and write 3-5 sentences assertion or reactions ​Nutrition and the Philippines: Nation at Risk MANILA, Philippines — "Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child's life." Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times - with or without disasters. Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities. In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. "At the center of malnutrition's underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices." Parreño added. “And we don't have a structure curriculum addressing this," he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9. Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle. The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also and school-based supplementary feeding programs. pa help po​</h2><br />

First e-sports college degree in the Philippines now in the works By Vince Ferreras, CNN Philippines Metro Manila — Online gaming might not be an after-school pastime anymore in the future as the first degree program in electronic sports (esports) in the country is being developed. The Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) and esports and gaming agency Tier One Entertainment collaborated to develop the curriculum of the four-year degree on Bachelor of Science in ESports. It will be offered this coming school year once approved by the Commission on Higher Education. “We will be passing the curriculum to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on March this year. If this goes well, we might have a full course available by 2020,” said Tier One Entertainment in a post on social media. The gaming agency’s chief executive officer Tryke Gutierrez said that the new degree program will have two tracks namely: game development and esports management. However, he did not disclose yet the subjects under the program. “The goal has always been to create more opportunities for gamers in Asia. If this curriculum gets approved, we won't just be providing post career opportunities for gaming, but we will have a new generation of graduates ready to work in the esports industry,” said Gutierrez in an online post.

Duterte assumed the presidency in 2016, his administration launched the relentless campaign against illegal drugs. The drug problem in the Philippines has primarily been viewed as an issue of law enforcement and criminality, he made it as one of his top campaign promises to solve the dug problem in the county and consequently, the government has focused on implementing a policy of criminalization and punishment.  </p><p></p><p>Since the start of the “war on drugs,” the Duterte government has applied all types of punitive measures and has mobilized the Philippine National Police and local government units in the whole nation. President Duterte’s war on drugs is morally and legally indefensible and has created significant and problemativ human rights violations; and is also counterproductive in addressing the drug problem.</p><p></p><p>We should recognize that the drug problem in our country is both a complex and multi-faceted problem.

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

Nutrition and the Philippines: ‘Nation at risk
MANILA, Philippines — “Under nutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.” 
Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters. 
Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.
In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. “At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.
Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<br />I strongly agree in the last paragraph where it says that improper child care would form a never ending cycle of poverty to the next generations. But I don't see what Dr. Martin Parreño is pointing out. Is he giving awareness? Is he informing the Filipino people? Then what is the purpose if they don't find a solution for the lack of nutrition that children are getting. All of these factual things but for what purpose? Dr. Juan Salcedo just wasted his time if his lecture didn't propose a hypothetical solution on what action a simple civilian can do to atleast increase the nutrition of their starving families.<br /><br />hope it helps.<br /><br /><br />

                            27. Activity 3 : Read the following paragraphs lifted from Marla Manlapig's "What's to blame for the low reading comprehension of the Filipino youth?" (CNN Philippines, April 21, 2020). Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION   EVIDENCE   CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

As of the third quarter of 2019, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ranked the Philippines above its Southeast Asian neighbors in terms of literacy with 97.95 percent of the total population able to read, write, and count, surpassing even more economically advanced nations like Singapore</p><p></p><br />
