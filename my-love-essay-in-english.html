I thoughtthen, "If it means not wanting to play anymore. I don't wantto be a teenager, overl"But now that I am a teenager myself, I have becomeless judgmental toward teenagers. I have seen for myselfhow things have become more complicated. Dealing withfriends, family, and handling varied emotions, I have givenrise to more concerns to think about.

                                            write the conjunction found in the essay below.?For years and years, English teachers at elementary and middle schools across the United States would have been astonished by that question. Mrs. Beedle, my fourth grade teacher, would have turned from the blackboard to glare at any student who asked such an absurd thing. (Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As we face the uncertainties brought about by Covid-19, the importance of learning through the English language is essential in adapting to the needs of the future generations. The pandemic hastened the acceptance of a more digitally inclined educational system and workplace. With technology comes the use of the English language hand in hand with the native language of the Filipinos</strong></p><p><strong>The pandemic pushed our government to implement extreme measures such as the enhanced community quarantine and its variations. Together with this, there were enforced limited mobility of people (especially the senior citizens, minors, and those with comorbidities), following of social or physical distancing, the wearing of facemasks and face shields, limited face-to-face interaction, and the promotion of personal health and disinfection.</strong></p><p><strong>The most crucial impact of the pandemic is seen through the rising unemployment due to the restrictions in the livelihood of people. Those persons who live through day-to-day jobs such as the jeepney drivers, tricycle drivers, food stall owners or vendors, and contractual employees are the mostly affected. Filipinos are resilient, and with it, former employees learn to create new jobs out of their talents</strong></p><p><strong>Jobs for online English teachers were an option for them. Likewise, opening of an online marketing business through social media became a hit for those who stayed home with internet access and a product to sell. A former barista in a restaurant who was laid off due to the lockdown, created a coffee vending business together with his former co-workers.</strong></p><p><strong>The Filipinos learned to adapt to changes brought about by uncertainties with the use of technology and the support of the family. In learning to cope with the challenges ahead, the academic community also opened its doors to globalizing education through the E-learning modalities, both synchronous and asynchronous.  Schools such as the St. Vincent de Ferrer College of Camarin strengthens its grip in digital education using technology and the English language in this time of crisis.</strong></p><p><strong>The families of Vincentian students are encouraged to learn and engage with the English language as we share our experiences of resilience in times of uncertainties. Students are enjoined to share their experiences by sending them to the email address of the year/grade English subject coordinators.</strong></p><p><strong>Learning the English language will open doors for the family by creating access to technology, information, and financial resources. It will also bring more educational and employment opportunities in the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Now is the time to “live, love and learn through the English language” as part of the Vincentian family in this time of pandemic.</strong></p><p><strong>pwede naba to?? ikaw na bahala mag edit sa ibang words </strong></p><p><strong>pa brainliest</strong></p><p></p><br />

(Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below:Sentence 1: The tree was tall and green.Sentence 2: The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>plss </strong></p><p><strong>na </strong><strong>banned </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>kasi acc </strong><strong>ko</strong></p><br />

                            11. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.
