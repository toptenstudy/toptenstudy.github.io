                                            STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

A school has six irregular graduating seniors: Allen (A), Ben (B), Cory (C), Dan (D), Ella (E), and Fe (F). You must prepare a special final exam schedule such that each student can take the exam in all his/her subjects in one day, but students with common subjects cannot be scheduled on the same day. Below are the subjects enrolled by each student:
A: English, Science, Politics
B: Science, Politics, Philosophy
C: Math, Philosophy, Art
D: English, French, Art
E: Politics, Art, Philosophy
F: Math, Science, Music
Construct a planar graph and using vertex coloring, find the fewest number of days that the 
ministration of the special exams can be done. Suggest one possible schedule.</h2><br />
                        <p>To construct a planar graph, we can first represent each student as a vertex, and connect two vertices with an edge if the corresponding students share at least one subject.</p><p></p><p>Here is the resulting planar graph:</p><p></p><p>css</p><p>Copy code</p><p>        F</p><p>       / \</p><p>      /   \</p><p>     C     B</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     M     P</p><p>      \   / \</p><p>       \ /   \</p><p>        D     E</p><p>         \   /</p><p>          \ /</p><p>           A</p><p>To find the fewest number of days needed, we need to find the chromatic number of this graph, which is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In other words, each color represents a different day, and vertices with the same color cannot share a day.</p><p></p><p>Using a greedy algorithm, we can start with the first vertex and color it with the first color. Then, we move to the next uncolored vertex and color it with the smallest available color that does not conflict with its neighbors. We repeat this process until all vertices are colored.</p><p></p><p>Here is one possible vertex coloring:</p><p></p><p>scss</p><p>Copy code</p><p>        F (1)</p><p>       / \</p><p>      /   \</p><p>     C (2)  B (3)</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     |     |</p><p>     M (1)  P (2)</p><p>      \   / \</p><p>       \ /   \</p><p>        D (3)  E (1)</p><p>         \   /</p><p>          \ /</p><p>           A (2)</p><p>This coloring uses only three colors, which means the special exams can be done in three days. Here is one possible schedule:</p><p></p><p>Day 1: F, M, E</p><p>Day 2: C, A, P</p><p>Day 3: B, D</p><br />

                            10. STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

                            12. Activity and Assessment (10 PTS EACH)
In a study determining the effectiveness of special reading and writing program to non-readers of Grade 7 students
of Lanzones National High School, researchers decide to conduct 1-hour remedial reading and 30 minutes writing
activity every day to those identified non-readers and students who have difficulty in writing. Furthermore, the
extent to which the program will be administered to the learners is determined, Write down at least 3 interventions
might be used in this research </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pre-assessment: Before the program begins, researchers might conduct a pre-assessment of the non-reader students' reading and writing abilities in order to establish a baseline for measuring progress. The assessment may include tests on reading comprehension, vocabulary, and writing skills.</p><p></p><p>Direct Instruction: The program will involve direct instruction in reading and writing skills, which will be delivered through a combination of individual and group activities. The reading instruction may include decoding, phonics, fluency, and comprehension strategies. The writing instruction may include grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and composition.</p><p></p><p>Scaffolding: Researchers might use scaffolding techniques to support the students during the program. This might include providing students with a structured approach to reading and writing, using visual aids, providing explicit instruction, and building on students' existing knowledge. Additionally, the use of graphic organizers, sentence frames, and other tools can be used to help students organize and express their ideas in writing.</p><p></p><p>Progress Monitoring: Researchers will closely monitor the progress of the students during the program, using a variety of assessment tools, such as reading and writing fluency assessments, comprehension tests, and writing samples. This will allow them to track the effectiveness of the program and make adjustments as needed.</p><p></p><p>Feedback and Support: Researchers will provide feedback and support to the students throughout the program. This might include providing students with constructive feedback on their reading and writing, highlighting areas for improvement, and giving them strategies for addressing difficulties. Additionally, researchers may provide emotional support for the students who are struggling, and help them to build their confidence and self-esteem.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
