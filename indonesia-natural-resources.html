                        <p>1. B. Japan, Indonesia, and also the Philippines are located within the pacific ring of fireside.</p><p><strong>The Ring of Fire</strong> is a chain of volcanoes and locations of seismic activity, or earthquakes, that encircles the <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong>'s perimeter. Approximately 90% of all earthquakes occur along <strong>the Ring of Fire</strong>, which also contains 75% of the world's active volcanoes. The Ring of Fire is not a perfect circle.</p><p></p><p>2. D. There will be moving immediately.</p><p>The r<strong>elative movement</strong> of geological features on either side of a fault line is the definition of slip. The slip sense of a fault is the relative movement of the rock on each side of the fault relative to the other.</p><p></p><p>3. A. Scientists checked the country's account.</p><p>They employ many methods to <strong>determine</strong> if a fault is active or inactive, such as examining historical descriptions of an area,<strong> observing</strong> the environment and <strong>conducting</strong> comprehensive research, and analyzing the past and current vibrations created by a fault.</p><p></p><p>4. B. It is where fault cyclones start.</p><p>It is a fracture in <strong>the crust</strong> of the Earth. It develops when rock above an inclined fracture plane moves downward and slides along the rock on the other side of the fracture. Normal faults are frequently found along divergent <strong>plate boundaries</strong>, such as where new crust is forming beneath the ocean. Normal faulting may also produce long, deep valleys.</p><p></p><p>5. C. epicenter</p><p>The focus is the location within the ground where <strong>the earthquake</strong> began, also known as the hypocenter. The<strong> epicenter</strong> is the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus.</p><p></p><p>6. B. focus</p><p>The earthquakes originate at the interface between tectonic plates. The <strong>focus</strong> is the location within the ground where the earthquake began, also known as the hypocenter. The epicenter is the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus.</p><p></p><p>7. C. philippine atmospheric, geophysical and astronomical services administration ( PAGASA )</p><p>People for Accountable Governance and Sustainable Action is the acronym for<strong> PAGASA</strong>. The mission of <strong>PAGASA</strong>, one of the attached agencies of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) under its Scientific and Technical Services Institutes, is to "provide protection against natural disasters and use scientific knowledge as an effective tool to ensure the safety, well-being, and economic security of the Philippines."</p><p></p><p>8. D. horizontal movement</p><p>Generally, three types of faults cause earthquakes: normal, strike-slip, and reverse (or thrust). All of these faults are capable of generating tsunamis, although the majority of tsunamis and the greatest ones are caused by<strong> earthquakes </strong>on reverse faults.</p><p></p><p>9. C. stick-slip</p><p>In laboratory studies with geologic materials,<strong> stick-slip</strong> commonly accompanies frictional sliding. Seismic events with a shallow focal depth may represent stick-slip along old or recently created faults.</p><p></p><p>10. A. the wave accelerates and grows tall.</p><p>Tsunamis are only dangerous when they approach land. As <strong>a tsunami </strong>approaches shallow water close to the coast, its speed decreases to 20 to 30 mph. The reduced <strong>wavelength</strong> increased height and intensified currents.</p><p></p><p>11. D. destructive</p><p>VII.<strong> Destructive</strong>. Most individuals are terrified and flee outside. It is difficult for people to stand on the upper floors. Heavy goods and furnishings topple or fall over.</p><p></p><p>12. D. magnitude</p><p><strong>Magnitude </strong>is the most popular metric for measuring the size of an earthquake. It is a measurement of the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the earthquake source and is the same number regardless of your location or the intensity of the shaking.</p><p></p><p>13. C. it is a large wave.</p><p>Tsunamis are enormous<strong> waves </strong>triggered by earthquakes or underwater volcanic eruptions. In the ocean's depths, tsunami waves do not increase in height drastically. As the waves go inland, however, the ocean's depth drops, causing their height to increase.</p><p></p><p>14. B. the rapid release of energy causes a delay in the movement of the bottom.</p><p>When the rough places can no longer hold,<strong> the rapid</strong> release of the accumulated motion occurs, causing an undersea earthquake. This location of horizontal and vertical slippage is known as the epicenter, has the largest magnitude, and causes the most damage.</p><p></p><p>15. A. intensity</p><p><strong>The magnitude</strong> measures the energy generated at the earthquake's epicenter. Seismograph readings are used to calculate magnitude. Intensity measures the magnitude of the earthquake's shaking at a certain site. Effects on individuals, human structures, and the natural environment affect the intensity.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about earthquakes here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/20646571</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ6</strong></p><p></p><br />
