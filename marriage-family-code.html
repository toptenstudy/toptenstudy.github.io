                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Anscombe Society believes that the intact, stable family is the most fundamental unit of society.  We hold that the intact family consists of a man and woman, bound together by marriage, along with whatever children they may have.  We define marriage as the exclusive and monogamous union between a man and a woman grounded in a commitment to mutual love and aid, with the intent to remain so committed until death. In most societies, this commitment is recognized by the state and by social custom.</p><p></p><p>We believe that the family provides the social support necessary for a stable society.  The intact, healthy family offers the best environment for raising children, providing them with the love, support, and education necessary for success in adult life.  The family, therefore, is the best institution for nurturing and rearing future generations, preparing them for the responsibilities that they will need to lead society later on.</p><p></p><p>The Anscombe Society believes that the institution of marri</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Law and politics are deeply intertwined.� Law is an essential tool of government action, an instrument with which government tries to influence society.� Law is also the means by which government itself is structured, regulated and controlled.� It is no surprise, then, that law is an important prize in the political struggle and that law shapes how politics is conducted.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The scholarly study of law and politics is a growing and diverse field.� The range of scholarship in the area reflects the wide scope of issues and questions that are relevant to the field of law and politics and that invite new and further study.� The diversity of scholarly interest in law and politics also reflects the interdisciplinary conversation that the field invites.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Law and Politics covers this ground as a new title in the Routledge series, Critical Concepts in Political Science.� Along with a new introduction by the editor, the four-volume collection brings together the best of canonical and cutting-edge works in the field.� It provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of law and politics and will stand as an essential research resource for scholars and students alike.</p><p></p><p>2. The Family Code of the Philippines (Executive Order no. 209) was signed into law by then President Corazon Aquino on July 6, 1987.</p><p></p><p>The basic law covering persons and family relations governs marriages, legal separations, property relations between spouses, and parental authority, among others.</p><p></p><p>Articles 96 and 124 of the Family Code discuss conjugal property.</p><p></p><p>They specify, among others, that the administration of community property belongs to both spouses jointly: “In case of disagreement, the husband’s decision shall prevail, subject to recourse to the court by the wife for proper remedy, which must be availed of within five years from the date of the contract implementing such decision.</p><p></p><p>“In the event that one spouse is incapacitated or otherwise unable to participate in the administration of the common properties, the other spouse may assume sole powers of administration. These powers do not include disposition or encumbrance without authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse. In the absence of such authority or consent, the disposition or encumbrance shall be void. However, the transaction shall be construed as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person, and may be perfected as a binding contract upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the offer is withdrawn by either or both offerors.”</p><br />
