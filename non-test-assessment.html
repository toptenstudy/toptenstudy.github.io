                            28. Deepen at these points, you are going to use internet or any reference to collect data worth investigating from the government agencies (e.g., mean age of high school students dropouts, mean salaries employee), Formulate the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for your data at hand. The scoring rubric will be used in assessing your performance. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO1. Formulate the null and alternative hypothesis of the data you collected.2. Identify whether the test to be administer in the data you have is directional or non-direction 3.

If the study is a laboratory experiment then we can call the hypothesis “an experimental hypothesis”, where we make a prediction about how the IV causes an effect on the DV.
