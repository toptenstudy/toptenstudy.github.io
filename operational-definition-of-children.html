Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

                                            QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</a>

Parents spend all their time and money trying to get the latest, most exciting gifts for their children. Children think about nothing but what their relatives and friends will give them. The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                            8. QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</h2><br />

Formulate your own opinion and compare it with the writer’s. Write your answers on the space provided.Christmas is all about money and material things these days. Parents spend all their time and money trying to get the latest, most exciting gifts for their children. Children think about nothing but what their relatives and friends will give them. The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
