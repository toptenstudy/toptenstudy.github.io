                                            Activity 2: Let’s Analyze! 
Directions: Read the scientific investigation story below. Choose the letter that corresponds to your answer. 
A group of Grade 7- Rizal students came across one interesting vlog of their favorite social media influencer that touches the idea of giving music to plants. It is from this fascinating idea that they thought of conducting similar investigation as part of their requirements in their science subject. 
They started to read books, surf the internet and study researches on the effect of music to plant growth. Members from the group continued to formulate their respective hypotheses. They went on performing a simple experiment. 
The group selected two San Francisco plants of similar size planted on the same type of soil and kind of pots. Both plants were healthy. Each plant were placed in separate rooms with a window exposed to full sunlight and were watered with equal amounts every day. They measured the height of the plants. 
Once a day, they played classical music on room 1 for about one hour while leaving room 2 with no music played. Over a period of two weeks, they noted significant differences in each plant’s growth. 
Multiple Choice: 
1. What was the problem in the Grade 7-Rizal’s experiment?
a. Which San Francisco plant is taller? 
b. What kind of music should be given to plants? 
c. How long can plants grow?

a. They placed two plants in one room and gave music to each. 
b. They planted the San Francisco in different pots and gave music to each. 
c. Same plants in similar soil and pots; both receive music. 
d. Same plant in similar soil and pots, with equal water and sunlight; only one plant received music. 
4. What do you think the group’s conclusion was? 
a. Plants grow with enough nutrients 
b. There is an increase on plants height when given music 
c. Music has no effect on plant growth 
d. Rich soil, water and sunlight are needed by plants 
5. Which is not a step in the scientific method? 
a. Formulate hypothesis c. Research 
b. Conduct experiment d. Ask people’s personal opinions 
6. What is the first step in conducting a scientific investigation? 
a. Arrive at a conclusion c. Observe and ask questions

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social Networks Sites (SNSs) are dominating all internet users’ generations, especially the students’ communities. Consequently, academic institutions are increasingly using SNSs which leads to emerge a crucial question regarding the impact of SNSs on students’ academic performance. This research investigates how and to what degree the use of SNSs affects the students’ academic performance. The current research’s data was conducted by using drop and collect surveys on a large population from the University of Jordan. 366 undergraduate students answered the survey from different faculties at the university. In order to study the impact of SNSs on student’s academic performance, the research hypotheses was tested by using descriptive analysis, T-test and ANOVA. Research results showed that there was a significant impact of SNS on the student’s academic performance. Also, there was a significant impact of SNS use per week on the student’s academic performance, whereas no differences found in the impact of use of SNSs on academic performance due to age, academic achievement, and use per day to most used sites. The findings of this research can be used to suggest future strategies in enhancing student’s awareness in efficient time management and better multitasking that can lead to improving study activities and academic achievements.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is the answer </p><p></p><p>Your welcome po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The hypothesis about social media and its influence on the social behavior of students suggests that the use of social media platforms has a significant impact on the way students interact with others and behave in social situations. This hypothesis is based on the idea that social media has become an integral part of students' lives, affecting not only their communication habits but also their perceptions of self and others.</p><p></p><p>The hypothesis suggests that students who use social media regularly may exhibit certain behaviors such as increased aggression, decreased empathy, and a stronger focus on appearance and popularity. On the other hand, students who use social media in moderation or not at all may display more positive social behaviors such as improved communication skills, enhanced emotional intelligence, and a greater sense of community.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that this hypothesis is not a blanket statement and may vary depending on the individual and their specific experiences with social media. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the relationship between social media and social behavior among students.</p><br />

Directions: Read the scientific investigation story below. Choose the letter that corresponds to your answer. 
A group of Grade 7- Rizal students came across one interesting vlog of their favorite social media influencer that touches the idea of giving music to plants. It is from this fascinating idea that they thought of conducting similar investigation as part of their requirements in their science subject. 
They started to read books, surf the internet and study researches on the effect of music to plant growth. Members from the group continued to formulate their respective hypotheses. They went on performing a simple experiment. 
The group selected two San Francisco plants of similar size planted on the same type of soil and kind of pots. Both plants were healthy. Each plant were placed in separate rooms with a window exposed to full sunlight and were watered with equal amounts every day. They measured the height of the plants. 
Once a day, they played classical music on room 1 for about one hour while leaving room 2 with no music played. Over a period of two weeks, they noted significant differences in each plant’s growth. 
Multiple Choice: 
1. What was the problem in the Grade 7-Rizal’s experiment?
a. Which San Francisco plant is taller? 
b. What kind of music should be given to plants?

d. Plants need good soil to grow faster. 
3. How did they test their hypothesis? 
a. They placed two plants in one room and gave music to each. 
b. They planted the San Francisco in different pots and gave music to each. 
c. Same plants in similar soil and pots; both receive music. 
d. Same plant in similar soil and pots, with equal water and sunlight; only one plant received music. 
4. What do you think the group’s conclusion was? 
a. Plants grow with enough nutrients 
b. There is an increase on plants height when given music 
c. Music has no effect on plant growth 
d. Rich soil, water and sunlight are needed by plants 
5. Which is not a step in the scientific method?
