EXCERPT A: "People should feel free to eat chocolates on a regular basis. Studies have shown that eating chocolates has positive health effects. For example, it is a food that improves one's mood. Many people report experiencing a feeling of happiness during and after eating chocolate. Also eating chocolate, especially dark chocolate, has been proven to be good for the heart because it acts as an antioxidant. But as we all know, the downside is that chocolates have a high calorie count in a relatively small serving - about 170 calories per 1- ounce serving of dark chocolate. Over time, eating too much chocolate or other foods with added sugars can lead to weight gain, diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other chronic conditions, says Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health." COUNTERCLAIM: TEXTUAL EVIDENCE: EXCERPT B: "Many Filipinos lack the knowledge about the geographical situation of the country and the threlies still live in a geologically unstable location or near bodies of water that are considered as disaster-prone areas. Filipino households surveyed across the country were found out to be unable to invest in disaster preparedness, mostly due to lack of funds and lack of time. But we have The National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Plan which was established to help make the communities be disaster resilient, to equip the community with necessary skills to cope with the negative effects. The Philippine Information Agency with the help of AFP, CHED, DepEd, DOH, PAG-ASA and PHIVOLCS are always updated to disseminate information. There are also educational, and communications programs being practiced nationwide." COUNTERCLAIM:​</a>

Write down your own counterclaim based on the assertion or claim mentioned in the text and the textual evidence that will validate it. EXCERPT A: "People should feel free to eat chocolates on a regular basis. Studies have shown that eating chocolates has positive health effects. For example, it is a food that improves one's mood. Many people report experiencing a feeling of happiness during and after eating chocolate. Also eating chocolate, especially dark chocolate, has been proven to be good for the heart because it acts as an antioxidant. But as we all know, the downside is that chocolates have a high calorie count in a relatively small serving - about 170 calories per 1- ounce serving of dark chocolate. Over time, eating too much chocolate or other foods with added sugars can lead to weight gain, diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other chronic conditions, says Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health." COUNTERCLAIM: TEXTUAL EVIDENCE: EXCERPT B: "Many Filipinos lack the knowledge about the geographical situation of the country and the threlies still live in a geologically unstable location or near bodies of water that are considered as disaster-prone areas. Filipino households surveyed across the country were found out to be unable to invest in disaster preparedness, mostly due to lack of funds and lack of time. But we have The National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Plan which was established to help make the communities be disaster resilient, to equip the community with necessary skills to cope with the negative effects. The Philippine Information Agency with the help of AFP, CHED, DepEd, DOH, PAG-ASA and PHIVOLCS are always updated to disseminate information. There are also educational, and communications programs being practiced nationwide." COUNTERCLAIM:​</h2><br />
