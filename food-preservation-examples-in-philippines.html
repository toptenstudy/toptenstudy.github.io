Take note that some statements are technically opinions, but are based on such widely accepted views of few people1. Eid is a religious festival celebrated by Muslims twice a year2. Chinese New Year is also known as Spring Festival.3. Personally, I think upholding our cultural practices through fiestas should be preserved for future generations4. Although widely celebrated, some find festivities impractical and expensive.5. In the Philippines, celebrating fiestas is still common.6. Old folks say that Catholic fiestas are celebrated to express their gratitude to the Lord through the intercession of the saints for a fruitful year.7. The procession on the Feast of the Black Nazarene takes place every year on the 9th of January.8. Thousands of devotees come to Quiapo to partake in the Traslacion, the procession to commemorate the transfer of the Black Nazarene image from Intramuros to Quiapo Church9. Absolutely, Traslacion is one of my most favorite religious celebrations in the country10. It is my belief that festivities like the Traslacion should be regarded as cultural identity markersof different races.11. Ice cream is the most delicious food.12. All living things need water to survive13. Roses are prettier than daisies.14. Baguio is the summer capital of the Philippines15. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example,by coughing into a flexed elbow).​</a>
