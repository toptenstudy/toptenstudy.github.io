                            2. 4. Discuss the concepts and theories related to physical growth and motor development of children and adolescents.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Overall, the studies found a positive association between fundamental motor skills and physical activity in children and adolescents, as well as a positive relationship between fundamental motor skills and cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Physical Development in Children and Adolescents<p>Physical development is the most readily visible of the child development domains.  Parents notice height and weight as well as the development of both fine motor and gross (large) motor skills.  It’s important to remember that what we can see physically corresponds to what we can’t see which is brain development.  In all developmental domains, the brain is promoting exploration and movement but when exploration and movement occur it also stimulates brain development including both neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) and synaptogenesis (forming new connections between brain cells).  In fact at various times during the first few years of life, a baby’s brain produces so many connections that they end up with more than in an adult brain.  Later through a process called pruning, synaptic connections that are not used by the child are eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Parents play an important role in all of the developmental domains and physical development is equally important.  Parent’s bonding with their child develops a sense of feeling safe to explore and positive feedback encourages a child to reach out more and push harder.  Parents also provide guidance and support through a process known as “scaffolding”.  Providing objects to encourage a baby to reach and grasp, holding the hands of a toddler while they take a few steps, teaching potty training, help a child with buttoning and zipping clothing, helping them learn to ride a bike and playing catch are just a few examples of how parents provide scaffolding to help children develop physical abilities.</p><p></p><p>In addition to encouraging and teaching specific skills, parents should promote a healthy lifestyle for their children.  This includes helping them to get adequate sleep, eat a well-balanced diet and stay active physically.  In this endeavor, the best approach for parents to take is to model the behavior as well as teach and encourage these very important health habits.  Teaching safety and maintaining a safe home environment (especially in the early years) is also very important.  Keeping up with regular check-ups and keeping immunizations up to date is important as well.</p><p></p><p>If you are concerned about possible delays in your child’s physical development we suggest you use the American Academy of Pediatrics: Motor Delay Tool and then discuss any concerns you have with your pediatrician.</p><p></p>Tips for ParentsA Few Things Parents Can Do To Promote Physical DevelopmentPlay with your child.  Play games that encourage physical development.  With baby’s, it could be as simple as showing them an interesting object and encouraging them to grab it and cheering them as they try.  Later it is playing outdoor games that encourage skills.For great ideas for play activities that encourage physical development as well as other types of development we highly recommend the Gymboree Play and Learn Series.Provide your child with toys as well as simple household objects that will encourage physical play.When they are ready take them to the park.  Let them run.  Run with them.  Let them play on the equipment like the swings and slides.If you have a pool, leave in a complex with a pool or visit friends with a pool or live near natural bodies of water, teach your child to swim at an early age.  Check around for programs near you.During the summer, make use of programs offered by local recreation and parks department and often community colleges as well that offer all types of instruction in sports and other physical activities.Learn yoga as a family, get a video and go for it.Go hiking as a family.Can’t always play outside?  Get Wii Fit and enjoy as a family.  Each member should set their own individual goals and encourage each other as well.Buy toys that are age appropriate and that encourage physical development and outdoor play here are some suggestions:  Sports and Outdoor Toys by Age GroupEncourage the development of fine motor skills by providing age-appropriate art materials.Encourage your child to try out different organized sports.  Hopefully, they will find one or two they enjoy.Limit screen time.  Encourage physical activities and playing with “real toys” rather than “virtual toys”.  These two books provide some useful suggestions:  Screen Time: How Electronic Media–From Baby Videos to Educational Software–Affects Your Young Child and   Reset Your Child’s Brain: A Four-Week Plan to End Meltdowns, Raise Grades, and Boost Social Skills by Reversing the Effects of Electronic Screen-Time.Encourage your child to participate in after-school sports.Encourage your child to participate in scouts.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana po makatulong</p><p>Follow for more!</p><p>God bless y'all</p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po </p><br />

                        <p>There are several basic concepts in social studies that can have an impact on various aspects of society, including self-reliance, peace and conflict resolution, social problems, growth and development, and human rights. Some of these concepts include:</p><p></p><p>Culture: Culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, behaviors, and practices of a group or society. Understanding different cultures can help promote self-reliance by fostering an appreciation for diversity and encouraging people to learn from one another. It can also help facilitate peace and conflict resolution by promoting understanding and respect for different cultural practices and values.</p><p></p><p>Power and authority: Power refers to the ability to influence or control others, while authority refers to the right to make decisions or exercise control. Understanding the dynamics of power and authority can help individuals and communities navigate conflicts and work towards resolution. It can also be important in addressing social problems, as imbalances of power can contribute to social inequalities and injustice.</p><p></p><p>Governance: Governance refers to the systems and processes by which a society is governed and decisions are made. Understanding how governance works can help individuals and communities participate in decision-making processes and advocate for their needs and interests. It can also be important in promoting growth and development, as effective governance can help create a stable and supportive environment for economic and social progress.</p><p></p><p>Human rights: Human rights refer to the fundamental rights and freedoms that are believed to be inherent to all human beings. Understanding and protecting human rights can be critical in promoting self-reliance, as it helps ensure that individuals have the freedom and opportunity to pursue their own goals and interests. It can also be important in promoting peace and conflict resolution, as respect for human rights can help create a more just and equitable society.</p><br />

                        <strong>FACTORS AFFECTING PHYSICAL GROWTH AND </strong><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong><p></p><p>Children's <strong>growth and development</strong> are influenced by both internal and external environmental influences, some of which are beyond our control. Knowing what children require at each stage of their <strong>growth and development </strong>allows us to properly raise them.</p><p>Although the phrases <strong>growth and development</strong> are used interchangeably, they have distinct biological meanings. Growth refers to gradual changes in physical qualities such as height, weight, size, and so on, whereas development refers to qualitative modifications to growth that end in maturity. <strong>Growth and development</strong> are mutually beneficial, interconnected, and occur concurrently. Most babies, for example, can weigh 8 to 10 kilos and sit up by the time they are 8 months old.</p><p></p><p>THE CONCEPT OF NATURE VS. NURTURE</p><p>Nature and nurture both contribute to children's <strong>growth and development</strong>. Although nature's endowment is unchanging, nurture can also make a significant influence. Here are some of the factors that influence children's growth and development.</p><p></p>Heredity<p>Heredity is the genetic transmission of physical features from parents to children. It has an impact on many areas of physical appearance, including height, weight, body shape, eye color, hair texture, and even intelligence and ability.</p><p></p>Environment<p>The environment is important in the development of children because it represents the sum total of physical and psychological stimulation received by the child.

                            27. a jurist who advocates the historical concept are mainly interested in the origin of law and its growth development​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jurisprudence, or legal theory, is the theoretical study of law. Scholars of jurisprudence seek to explain the nature of law in its most general form and provide a deeper understanding of legal reasoning and analogy, legal systems, legal institutions, and the role of law in society.[1]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations.[2] General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.[3]</p><p></p><p>This article addresses three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. Ancient natural law is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain whatever force they have.[3] Analytic jurisprudence (Clarificatory jurisprudence) rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.[4] It encompasses such theories of jurisprudence as "legal positivism", which holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from basic social facts;[5] and "legal realism", which argues that the real-world practice of law determines what law is, the law having the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers, and judges do with it. Normative jurisprudence is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. It not only addresses the question "What is law?", but also tries to determine what the proper function of law should be, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.</p><p></p><p>ur welcome.</p><br />
