Please, stop complaining.Assessment 1Read carefully the given manifesto, then try to analyze it using the guide questions that follow:The Other Side of E-Mail Robert Kuttner(1) A few years ago, when my daughter was a college freshman, I wrote a column singing thepraises of e-mail. We were suddenly corresponding. It was, I decided, the revenge of print onelectronics - whole generation raised on the tube and the phone, rediscovering the lost art ofwriting letters. How utterly charming.(2) Now I'm not so sure. Like all new media, e-mail has a dark side. To be sure, it saves a greatdeal of time and paperwork and has facilitated new, unimagined forms of affinity. However, e-mailis also a thief. It steals our time and our privacy. It deceives us into thinking we have endlessadditional hours in the day to engage in far-flung communications that we may or may not needor want.(3) All of a sudden, on top of everything else we have to do, e-mail is one more gardendemanding tending.(4) E-mail brings a kind of pseudo-urgency that demands an instant response. It creates falseintimacies. Recently, I got an e-mail message from a perfect stranger, a student who had read oneof my articles and wanted help on a term paper. I was touched, but alas, there aren't enough hoursin the day. Yet something about the message made me feel I needed to apologize for not being ableto do her homework. With e-mail, it's too easy to hit the reply key, with results you may regret.One acquaintance, thinking she was just responding to a note from a close friend, accidentallysent a highly personal message to the friend's entire mailing list.(5) I recently had a painful quarrel triggered by e-mail messages. A dear friend and I were bothhaving a busy week and imposing on each other's time. Without quite intending to, we ended upfiring salvos of e-mail back and forth of escalating testiness until we had quite insulted each other.We apologized, in person.​</a>

Please, stop complaining.Assessment 1Read carefully the given manifesto, then try to analyze it using the guide questions that follow:The Other Side of E-Mail Robert Kuttner(1) A few years ago, when my daughter was a college freshman, I wrote a column singing thepraises of e-mail. We were suddenly corresponding. It was, I decided, the revenge of print onelectronics - whole generation raised on the tube and the phone, rediscovering the lost art ofwriting letters. How utterly charming.(2) Now I'm not so sure. Like all new media, e-mail has a dark side. To be sure, it saves a greatdeal of time and paperwork and has facilitated new, unimagined forms of affinity. However, e-mailis also a thief. It steals our time and our privacy. It deceives us into thinking we have endlessadditional hours in the day to engage in far-flung communications that we may or may not needor want.(3) All of a sudden, on top of everything else we have to do, e-mail is one more gardendemanding tending.(4) E-mail brings a kind of pseudo-urgency that demands an instant response. It creates falseintimacies. Recently, I got an e-mail message from a perfect stranger, a student who had read oneof my articles and wanted help on a term paper. I was touched, but alas, there aren't enough hoursin the day. Yet something about the message made me feel I needed to apologize for not being ableto do her homework. With e-mail, it's too easy to hit the reply key, with results you may regret.One acquaintance, thinking she was just responding to a note from a close friend, accidentallysent a highly personal message to the friend's entire mailing list.(5) I recently had a painful quarrel triggered by e-mail messages. A dear friend and I were bothhaving a busy week and imposing on each other's time. Without quite intending to, we ended upfiring salvos of e-mail back and forth of escalating testiness until we had quite insulted each other.We apologized, in person.​</h2><br />
