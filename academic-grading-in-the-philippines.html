(2)However, no experimental studies have been conducted effectiveness when integrated. (3)This study, therefore, aims to fill in this gap by investigating the effects of combining MFI and FFFI in developing the speaking, writing, and grammar skills of selected secondary ESL students in public high schools in the Philippines. The participants involved in this study are 480 third year high school students (Grade 9). (4)These students were divided into four groups.

I Getting college education in a private school in the Philippines is expensive because of several reasons. First, the college tution fees and miscellaneous fees range from PhP 10,000 to even more than PhP 100,000.00 (depending on the academic program being undertaken). Second, the books are costly. Third, materials like papers, notebooks, and other school and office supplies are also costly. Finally, there are also special fees, like fees for removal examinations or completion of grades. The fees that college students pay seem not only endless, but increasing in prices, as well.

Analyze the ideas presented, then make a report differing the viewpoints between Senator .Gatchalian and Education Undersecretary San Antonio. Give your personal viewpoints about it. MANILA - Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said Wednesday he was surprised at the Department of Education's report that over 99 percent of students passed the first grading period of the current school year, which saw Philippine schools shift to distance learning due to the pandemic. At a Senate hearing, a presentation by Education Undersecretary Diosdado San Antonio showed that 99.13 percent of students obtained passing marks during the first quarter. The figure was based on reports submitted by 156 out of 223 school divisions across the country and had yet to include data from the Ilocos Region, Central Visayas, National Capital Region and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. "We're not after the intention of misrepresentation of data. We just need to appreciate it fully. But for now, personally, this is my personal thought, it was just surprising that the results were all 99 percent," said Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate basic education committee. The education official noted that the basis for most of the grades were performance tasks and written outputs since schools did not administer the usual periodic examinations. San Antonio also attributed the passing mark to the DepEd's academic ease policy, which gives flexibility to students in answering and submitting requirements. Gatchalian showed an assessment done by the DepEd's division office in Valenzuela City, where he previously served as mayor and legislative district representative. The assessment showed that Valenzuela students from Grade 7 to 10 had an overall average performance rate of 48 percent to 55 percent across different subjects. "These are just preliminary results but I wanted to get an indication somehow of whether our students are learning. This sounds more realistic, frankly speaking, compared to the 99 percent who passed," Gatchalian said. "Of course, I want all of them to pass but realistically, we all know the performance of our students," the lawmaker added. Viewpoint A: Viewpoint B: My personal Viewpoint:​</a>

MANILA – Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said Wednesday he was surprised at the
Department of Education’s report that over 99 percent of students passed the
first grading period of the current school year, which saw Philippine schools shift
to distance learning due to the pandemic.
At a Senate hearing, a presentation by Education Undersecretary Diosdado San
Antonio showed that 99.13 percent of students obtained passing marks during
the first quarter.
The figure was based on reports submitted by 156 out of 223 school divisions
across the country and had yet to include data from the Ilocos Region, Central
Visayas, National Capital Region and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.
“We’re not after the intention of misrepresentation of data. We just need to
appreciate it fully. But for now, personally, this is my personal thought, it was
just surprising that the results were all 99 percent,” said Gatchalian, chairman
of the Senate basic education committee.

San Antonio also attributed the passing mark to the DepEd’s academic ease
policy, which gives flexibility to students in answering and submitting

                                            4. Educational researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between reading andacademic success. "Research findings in applied linguistics and reading research consistentlyshow a strong correlation between reading proficiency and academic success at all ages, fromthe primary school right through to university level: students who read a lot and whounderstand what they read usually attain good grades" (Pretorious, 2000). An ACT news release(Aug. 17, 2005) stated, "Reading skills are critical to a student's success in college coursesacross the board... students who don't have adequate reading comprehension skills are likely tostruggle.” Proficient reading skills are inextricably linked to problem solving, critical thinking,writing, researching, reasoning, and creativity. In other words, a student who is a good reader ismore likely to do well in school and pass exams than a student who is a weak reader.(Adopted from A Critique of K - 12 Philippine Education System by Maria Teresa F.

Sherwin Gatchalian said Wednesday he was surprised at the Department of Education's report that over 99 percent of students passed the first grading period of the current school year, which saw Philippine schools shift to distance learning due to the pandemic. At a Senate hearing, a presentation by Education Undersecretary Diosdado San Antonio showed that 99.13 percent of students obtained passing marks during the first quarter. The figure was based on reports submitted by 156 out of 223 school divisions across the country and had yet to include data from the Ilocos Region, Central Visayas, National Capital Region and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. "We're not after the intention of misrepresentation of data. We just need to appreciate it fully. But for now, personally, this is my personal thought, it was just surprising that the results were all 99 percent," said Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate basic education committee. The education official noted that the basis for most of the grades were performance tasks and written outputs since schools did not administer the usual periodic examinations. San Antonio also attributed the passing mark to the DepEd's academic ease policy, which gives flexibility to students in answering and submitting requirements. Gatchalian showed an assessment done by the DepEd's division office in Valenzuela City, where he previously served as mayor and legislative district representative. The assessment showed that Valenzuela students from Grade 7 to 10 had an overall average performance rate of 48 percent to 55 percent across different subjects. "These are just preliminary results but I wanted to get an indication somehow of whether our students are learning. This sounds more realistic, frankly speaking, compared to the 99 percent who passed," Gatchalian said. "Of course, I want all of them to pass but realistically, we all know the performance of our students," the lawmaker added. Viewpoint A: Viewpoint B: My personal Viewpoint:​</h2><br />

It may be more appropriate to look at the overall performance rate of students across different subjects, as shown in the assessment from Valenzuela City, to get a more accurate picture of student learning. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide quality education to all students, regardless of the mode of delivery or the circumstances they face.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>pa brainliest po </p><br />

MANILA – Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said Wednesday he was surprised at the
Department of Education’s report that over 99 percent of students passed the
first grading period of the current school year, which saw Philippine schools shift
to distance learning due to the pandemic.
At a Senate hearing, a presentation by Education Undersecretary Diosdado San
Antonio showed that 99.13 percent of students obtained passing marks during
the first quarter.
The figure was based on reports submitted by 156 out of 223 school divisions
across the country and had yet to include data from the Ilocos Region, Central
Visayas, National Capital Region and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.
“We’re not after the intention of misrepresentation of data. We just need to
appreciate it fully. But for now, personally, this is my personal thought, it was
just surprising that the results were all 99 percent,” said Gatchalian, chairman
of the Senate basic education committee.
The education official noted that the basis for most of the grades were
performance tasks and written outputs since schools did not administer the
usual periodic examinations.
San Antonio also attributed the passing mark to the DepEd’s academic ease
policy, which gives flexibility to students in answering and submitting
requirements.
Gatchalian showed an assessment done by the DepEd’s division office in
Valenzuela City, where he previously served as mayor and legislative district
representative.
The assessment showed that Valenzuela students from Grade 7 to 10 had an
overall average performance rate of 48 percent to 55 percent across different
subjects.
“These are just preliminary results but I wanted to get an indication somehow of
whether our students are learning. This sounds more realistic, frankly speaking,
compared to the 99 percent who passed,” Gatchalian said.
“Of course, I want all of them to pass but realistically, we all know the
performance of our students,” the lawmaker added.

                            18. 4. Educational researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between reading andacademic success. "Research findings in applied linguistics and reading research consistentlyshow a strong correlation between reading proficiency and academic success at all ages, fromthe primary school right through to university level: students who read a lot and whounderstand what they read usually attain good grades" (Pretorious, 2000). An ACT news release(Aug. 17, 2005) stated, "Reading skills are critical to a student's success in college coursesacross the board... students who don't have adequate reading comprehension skills are likely tostruggle.” Proficient reading skills are inextricably linked to problem solving, critical thinking,writing, researching, reasoning, and creativity. In other words, a student who is a good reader ismore likely to do well in school and pass exams than a student who is a weak reader.(Adopted from A Critique of K - 12 Philippine Education System by Maria Teresa F.

But for now, personally, this is my personal thought, it wasjust surprising that the results were all 99 percent," said Gatchalian.chairmanof the Senate basic education committee.​The education offcial noted that the basis for most of the grades wereperformance toond witten outputs since schools did not administer theusual periodo exaginations.San Antonio also oftributed the passing mark to the DepEd's academic easepolicy. which gives flexibility to students in answering and submittingrequirements.Gatchalian showed an assessment done by the DepEd's division office inValenzuela City, where he previously served as mayor and legislative districtrepresentativeThe assessment showed that Valenzuela students from Grade 7 10 10 had anoverall average pformance rate of 48 percent lo 55 percent acrossdifferent subjects"These are just prefinary results but I wanted to get an indication somehowof whether ordents are learning. This sounds more realistic. franklyspeaking, compared to the 99 percent who passed." Gatchalian said."Of course, Iwan pil of them to pass but realistically, we all know theDerfomance of od students." the lawmaker added.Retrieved from primoron.com/news/03/03/21/patchalon-surprised-99-pot-of-leamerspostgradinarioViewpoint A:Viewpoint-B:My personal Viewpoint:​pa help po</h2><br />
