What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay about Big Five Personality Traits</p><p>   -</p><p></p><p>Personality, Attitudes, and Values Reflections</p><p></p><p>Personalities are the relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns that people have. Behavior is jointly determined by the person and the situation. Personalities make people different from each other. If we can understand someone’s personality, we can get clues on how he or she might act in certain situations. Our personalities change and evolve from experiences that we have had. Our personalities are also determined by the attention you received as a child, the style of parenting that was used on you, and successes and failures you had in high school. Our personalities change over time. We become more organized and dependable and more emotionally stable in our twenties and thirties. There are 5 big personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Openness is being curious, intellectual, original, creative, and open to new ideas. Open people are highly motivated to learn new skills and are highly adaptable to change. They are also more likely to start their own business. Conscientiousness is being organized, systematic, punctual, achievement oriented, and dependable. Conscientious people can be predicted on how high their performance will be. They also are more likely to start their own business. Extraversion is being outgoing, talkative, sociable, and enjoying social situations. Extraverts tend to be more effective in jobs that involve sales since they like to talk. They also tend to be effective as managers and happier at work. Agreeableness is being affable, tolerant, sensitive, trusting, kind, and warm. Agreeable people are likeable and get along well with others. They are also less likely to get mad when people treat them unfairly. Neuroticism is being anxious, irritable, temperamental, and moody. Neurotic people have a tendency to have emotional adjustment problems and experience a number of problems at work. My scores for the personality quiz are: Introvert (22%), Sensing (50%), Feeling (38%), and Perceiving (11%). The test says that I am slightly more an introvert than an extrovert. I would say that is pretty accurate because I tend to keep to myself until I get to know someone and then I become a little more outgoing. The test also says that I am moderately more sensing than intuitive. This is very true because my intuition seems to never be right. The test then says that I am moderately more feeling over thinking. I think this is also very true because I almost always use my values and thoughts to make a decision. Lastly, the test says that I am slightly more perceiving than judging. I think this is also pretty accurate because I think I am open-minded. Overall, I would say that this personality quiz was very accurate. I am kind of surprised of how accurate it was. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The answer is a bit long, but I hope it's okay to help</p><p></p><br />

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations

D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear
