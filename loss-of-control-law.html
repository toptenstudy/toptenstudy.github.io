The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</a>

                                            President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall.

                                            The French and Indian War is significant in American history because 
(READ EACH possible answer carefully) 
 a
The British were victorious in war, but that victory came at a high price. Plus, the new land needed a military presence to protect it, which also cost a great deal of money. So, Great Britain had debt. To get out of debt, Great Britain created a series of laws that placed new political and economic burdens on the colonies. The colonies resented these new laws and eventually military conflict between England and it's colonies took place.
 b
Great Britain won the French and Indian War gaining new land and a great deal of new debt. To pay off that debt, Great Britain sold all of the land west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Spanish government. The Colonists were angry about the loss of the land because they had been promised that they could settle on that land after the hated French were defeated. So, the colonists began to rebel leading to a new nation.
 c
Great Britain won the French &amp; Indian war but lost the Seven Years war. As a result, Great Britain was forced to pay millions of dollars in reparation payments to the French and Spanish. This British forced the colonists to pay the Spanish and the French by trading only with those two nations. The American merchants lost money and began a rebellion in Massachusetts leading to the birth of the United States of America.
 d
Great Britain won both the French and Indian War and the Seven Years War. The victories in war gave Great Britain tremendous WEALTH. Great Britain began used that wealth to create a new policy of sending troops to the colonies to strengthen their control over the 13 Colonies. The Colonists resented the British troops and the series of laws created by Parliament to regain greater control of the Colonists. As a result, the colonists, for both political and economic reasons, began to rebel against the British and thus created the United States of America.</a>

The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</h2><br />

                            7. President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall. Some local governments and schools have called off classes to undergo disinfection protocols. In a Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said he respected the decision of local governments but stressed that he does not see a need to call for a lockdown in Metro Manila. As of March 8, 2020, there are a total of 105,586 cases of Covid-19 that has spread to 101 countries. DOH has placed the country under Covid-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 1 to prepare national and local governments and the country’s health care providers for possible increases in suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.

                            8. The French and Indian War is significant in American history because 
(READ EACH possible answer carefully) 
 a
The British were victorious in war, but that victory came at a high price. Plus, the new land needed a military presence to protect it, which also cost a great deal of money. So, Great Britain had debt. To get out of debt, Great Britain created a series of laws that placed new political and economic burdens on the colonies. The colonies resented these new laws and eventually military conflict between England and it's colonies took place.
 b
Great Britain won the French and Indian War gaining new land and a great deal of new debt. To pay off that debt, Great Britain sold all of the land west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Spanish government. The Colonists were angry about the loss of the land because they had been promised that they could settle on that land after the hated French were defeated. So, the colonists began to rebel leading to a new nation.
 c
Great Britain won the French &amp; Indian war but lost the Seven Years war. As a result, Great Britain was forced to pay millions of dollars in reparation payments to the French and Spanish. This British forced the colonists to pay the Spanish and the French by trading only with those two nations. The American merchants lost money and began a rebellion in Massachusetts leading to the birth of the United States of America.
 d
Great Britain won both the French and Indian War and the Seven Years War. The victories in war gave Great Britain tremendous WEALTH. Great Britain began used that wealth to create a new policy of sending troops to the colonies to strengthen their control over the 13 Colonies. The Colonists resented the British troops and the series of laws created by Parliament to regain greater control of the Colonists. As a result, the colonists, for both political and economic reasons, began to rebel against the British and thus created the United States of America.</h2><br />
