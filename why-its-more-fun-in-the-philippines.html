MANILA- Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4, the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions emain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Answer. 4. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing, but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about heir busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't ech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have ecome a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the- ellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities. nswer. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

MANILA, Philippines San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped the Tropang Giga's perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

However most fruits are plentiful when in season. Mangoes are mostly in season in May caimitos in March and lanzones in October. Bananas grow the whole year round. Fruit trees that grow in different places bear more fruits at different seasons. That is why in December we can buy lanzones from Mindanao even though the lanzones season in Laguna is over.

MANILA- Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4, the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions emain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Answer. 4. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months.

But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about heir busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't ech savvy to order online for everyday essentials.

MANILA, Philippines San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped the Tropang Giga's perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.
