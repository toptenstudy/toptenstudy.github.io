                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The pandemic highly needs the resiliency of the Filipino people, and even across the nations who are badly affected by this crisis. The end of this crisis may seem a little impossible for now while we are still rooting for the vaccine, but this should not keep us from living our lives. We have to make the necessary adjustments and adaptations because if not, then we will all suffer in stagnation and fear.</p><p></p><p>Let us keep a spirit of strong belief that we will all go through this victoriously. This too shall pass, but as we await, let us learn to live well anyway. Let us keep our hopes up because we deserve to stand strong and fight a good fight ahead. Let us serve one another and bless each other with whatever we got in our possessions. Let us not grow timid, not extending any help for others at all when we can and we should.</p><p></p><p>May we not dwell on the tremendous and tragic impact of this pandemic, but may we look at the blessings that we have on our hands. We have our families who survive with us no matter how tough it gets. We will get through this, and we will grow, too.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><br />

                        <p>The pandemic highly needs the resiliency of the Filipino people, and even across the nations who are badly affected by this crisis.  The end of this crisis may seem a little impossible for now while we are still rooting for the vaccine, but <strong>this should not keep us from living our lives</strong>.  We have to make the necessary adjustments and adaptations because if not, then we will all suffer in stagnation and fear.
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us keep a spirit of strong belief that we will all go through this victoriously.  This too shall pass, but as we await, let us learn to live well anyway.  Let us keep our hopes up because we deserve to stand strong and fight a good fight ahead.  Let us serve one another and bless each other with whatever we got in our possessions.  Let us not grow timid, not extending any help for others at all when we can and we should.
</p><p>
</p><p>May we not dwell on the tremendous and tragic impact of this pandemic, but may we look at the blessings that we have on our hands.  We have our families who survive with us no matter how tough it gets.  <strong>We will get through this, and we will grow, too.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many people take for granted the opportunities they receive through the hard work of others, but this attitude needs to stop because it has become the “norm” for students to expect their teachers and professors to provide them with an education. While it is true that in the United States, students are required to attend school until the age of eighteen, many children around the world lack this luxury. This “right” is commonly looked down upon by students, because they do not have the motivation to succeed, as they did not have to work to get into school and to pay for their schooling. Everyone takes something for granted, whether it is an education, a roof over one’s head, food on the table, or the commencement speaker at one’s high school graduation, everyone forgets to be thankful. As Admiral McRaven stated, “But of all the things I remember, I don’t have a clue who the commencement speaker was that evening, and I certainly don’t</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Rather than continuing to take the opportunities presented to me for granted, I will strive to use these chances to make a difference in the lives’ of others. As Admiral McRaven said, “Generations were saved by one decision, by one person.” The presence of one person and their decisions can easily change the lives of dozens of people if that person allows themselves to invest in the lives’ of those around them. As a member of the Embry-Riddle Prescott Honors Program, I am held to and hold myself to a higher standard. By making the most of my time at Embry-Riddle, I can not only change my own future, but also influence the decisions others make. I will use my time at Embry-Riddle to change not only my own life, but those of my peers through listening to the advice of Admiral McRaven, and using my decisions to change the world around me, rather than taking for granted the opportunity to positively impact another</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>800+ words</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Formal Speech Style</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What distinguishes the formal speech style from the consultative style is the lack of listener participation. Unlike in interactions that use the consultative style, the listener does not participate, in most cases, in an interaction that requires the formal style. A formal style is often used in formal situations, such as in a graduation ceremony, an official meeting, a television newscast, and a conference, where there is only one-way communication. Since there is little or no feedback from the listeners or audience, the speaker needs to plan ahead of his or her utterances, or what he or she is going to say. Other characteristics of the formal style are:
</p><p>  </p><p>a. Interruptions are not allowed. Only the speaker is the source of information.
</p><p>b. Pronunciation is very clear.
</p><p>c. Words are carefully chosen, and grammar rules are followed.
</p><p>d. Sentence structures are more complex and varied.
</p><p>e. Extensive and technical vocabulary is required.
</p><p>f. Ideas are cohesive and organized.
</p><p>g. All background or necessary information is clearly given.
</p><p>This speech style is also used in sermons, speeches, and announcements. This is also the style that is used for academic and business writing.

                            29.  A life coach is someone who helps people identify their goals and develop an actionable plan to achieve them. To help the people who were affected by the recent COVID-19, give a 2 or 3-minute persuasive memorized speech. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>When we hear the word grief, we often associate it with extreme loss such as the death of a loved one. But loss is loss, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, and with loss, comes grief.
</p><p>
</p><p>Think about all of the things you’ve lost in the last several weeks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People have lost loved ones, income, and their health. Allow our feelings to settle in. All that we feel is valid. Feel it now instead of having to deal with it piece by piece. Give ourself space and time identify traumas and troubles that this pandemic has brought on. When we aren’t aware of what we are feeling, challenging circumstances may cause the figurative formation of protective scar tissue around our hearts, which make us immune to certain emotions. But, if it hasn’t already, the impact of the collective global pain that we are all experiencing in the wake of this pandemic will crack our feeling-proof fortresses wide open. Suddenly, we will be left feeling everything, exposed to more intense emotions than we’ve ever felt before.
</p><p>It’s okay if you have not done anything productive like what the other people are doing. What’s important is that you are alive. You are here. In this moment. You are here for your friends and family.  </p><p>
</p><p>Give yourself grace for grief. Acknowledge it, allow it, and release self-imposed guilt or shame. Grant yourself permission, space and all of the time you need to feel your feelings. Offer gratitude for all that is not lost, including you. You are still here, and you are not alone.
