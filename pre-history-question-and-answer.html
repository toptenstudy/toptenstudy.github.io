Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                                            Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1The culture of the Philippines, an island country in the South-East Asia, represents a huge range of very outstanding and fascinating traditions. Nevertheless, for anyone who would like to discuss the issue of the Filipino contemporary theatre, the difficult and very complicated postcolonial history of the country appears as one of the main challenges. The Philippines were first colonized by Spain (1565-1898) and later (in the 20th century) by the USA. People in the Philippines used to say that they had spent 350 years in the convent and 50 years in Hollywood. But as long as we can speak about a strong influence, which both of those countries had on the Filipino nation and culture, we cannot forget that we can never speak about the entire removal of local traditions and aesthetics.</p><p></p><p>aw8 sa 50pts mo te</p><br />

                            5. Read the (EXPOSITORY TEXT) below and try to answer the question and pls try to answer that correctly.
Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                            6. Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.
