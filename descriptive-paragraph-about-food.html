A friend and I wanted to visit a castlein Seoul, so we found some locals who agreed to take us to see it. As we werewalking up some steps from one part of the grounds to another, I saw some peoplewatching us from the top of the steps. When I got to the top, someone I had neverseen before mentioned my sister's name and asked if I was her sister. I almostcouldn't talk! How could these people know my sister, who lived in Australia? Theyexplained that they were my sister's neighbors in Australia and that I looked just likeher. It was the strangest experience in my life!________3. Hanging on my bedroom wall is a picture of a train.Sometimes, when I'm lying on my bed, I take a closer look. The front of the train hasa number of flags, but they don't look like today's American flag. Instead, these flagshave stripes and a circle of stars. The train is at a station, and the conductor iswalking toward the tracks in front of the train. Is he preparing to speak to all of thehat-wearing men and children behind him, or is he checking out the tracks? I can'tdecide. The clock on the post outside the station says it is about six fifteen, and I'mguessing that it's evening and not morning since it doesn't look dark. I can justimagine the smell of coal and hear the sound of the train as it snorts and breathes.​</a>

                                            I. Directions: Read the following paragraphs then, identify their text type. Choose from DESCRIPTIVE, INFORMATIVE, NARRATIVE, PERSUASIVE, or PROCEDURAL.1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains, strong winds are brought about by low pressure. 3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy our crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always a food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) 4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. 5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.​</a>

Directions: On a separate sheet of paper, illustrate the world that the great Being created in
the selection, The Origin of This World (Maranao). Write a short descriptive paragraph
about your illustration.
1
According to Maranaw folklore, thisworld was created by a great Being.It is not known, however,
who exactly is this great Being. Or how many days it took him to create this world.
2
This world is divided into seven layers. The earth has also seven layers. Each layer is inhabited
by a different kind of being. The uppermost layer, for example, is the place we are inhabiting. The
second layer is being inhabited by dwarfs. These dwarfs are short, plump, and long-haired. They
are locally known as Karibanga. The Karibanga are said to possess magical powers. They are
usually invisible to the human eye. The third layer of the earth which is found under the sea or
lake is inhabited by nymphs. These nymphs also possess certain magical powers. It is stated in
the story of Rajah Indarapatra that he met and fell in love with the princess nymph with whom
he had a child.
3
The sky also consists of seven layers. Each layer has a door which is guarded day and night
by huge mythical birds called garoda. The seventh layer of the sky is the seat of heaven which
is also divided into seven layers. Every layer in the sky is inhabited by angels. Maranaws
believe that angels do not need food. They all possess wings with which they fly.
4
Heaven which is found on the seventh layer of the sky is where good people‘s spirits go after
death. Saints are assigned to the seventh layer while persons who “barely made it” are confined
to the lower most layer which is found at the bottom of heaven.
5
It is in heaven where we find the tree-of-life. On each leaf of the tree-of-life is written the
name of every person living on earth. As soon as a leaf ripens or dries and falls, the person
whose name it carries also dies.
6
The soul of every person is found in tightly covered jars kept in one section of heaven. This
particular section of heaven is closely guarded by a monster with a thousand eyes, named
Walo. Walo, in addition to his thousand eyes, has also eight hairy heads. The epic Darangan
speaks of Madale, Bantugan‘s brother and, Mabaning, Husband of Lawanen, entering this
section and retrieving the soul of Bantugan.</a>

A friend and I wanted to visit a castlein Seoul, so we found some locals who agreed to take us to see it. As we werewalking up some steps from one part of the grounds to another, I saw some peoplewatching us from the top of the steps. When I got to the top, someone I had neverseen before mentioned my sister's name and asked if I was her sister. I almostcouldn't talk! How could these people know my sister, who lived in Australia? Theyexplained that they were my sister's neighbors in Australia and that I looked just likeher. It was the strangest experience in my life!________3. Hanging on my bedroom wall is a picture of a train.Sometimes, when I'm lying on my bed, I take a closer look. The front of the train hasa number of flags, but they don't look like today's American flag. Instead, these flagshave stripes and a circle of stars. The train is at a station, and the conductor iswalking toward the tracks in front of the train. Is he preparing to speak to all of thehat-wearing men and children behind him, or is he checking out the tracks? I can'tdecide. The clock on the post outside the station says it is about six fifteen, and I'mguessing that it's evening and not morning since it doesn't look dark. I can justimagine the smell of coal and hear the sound of the train as it snorts and breathes.​</h2><br />

The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains, strong winds are brought about by low pressure. 3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy our crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always a food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) 4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. 5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.​</h2><br />

                            17. B.Draw and Tell
Directions: On a separate sheet of paper, illustrate the world that the great Being created in
the selection, The Origin of This World (Maranao). Write a short descriptive paragraph
about your illustration.
1
According to Maranaw folklore, thisworld was created by a great Being.It is not known, however,
who exactly is this great Being. Or how many days it took him to create this world.
2
This world is divided into seven layers. The earth has also seven layers. Each layer is inhabited
by a different kind of being. The uppermost layer, for example, is the place we are inhabiting. The
second layer is being inhabited by dwarfs. These dwarfs are short, plump, and long-haired. They
are locally known as Karibanga. The Karibanga are said to possess magical powers. They are
usually invisible to the human eye. The third layer of the earth which is found under the sea or
lake is inhabited by nymphs. These nymphs also possess certain magical powers. It is stated in
the story of Rajah Indarapatra that he met and fell in love with the princess nymph with whom
he had a child.
3
The sky also consists of seven layers. Each layer has a door which is guarded day and night
by huge mythical birds called garoda. The seventh layer of the sky is the seat of heaven which
is also divided into seven layers. Every layer in the sky is inhabited by angels. Maranaws
believe that angels do not need food. They all possess wings with which they fly.
4
Heaven which is found on the seventh layer of the sky is where good people‘s spirits go after
death. Saints are assigned to the seventh layer while persons who “barely made it” are confined
to the lower most layer which is found at the bottom of heaven.
5
It is in heaven where we find the tree-of-life. On each leaf of the tree-of-life is written the
name of every person living on earth. As soon as a leaf ripens or dries and falls, the person
whose name it carries also dies.
6
The soul of every person is found in tightly covered jars kept in one section of heaven. This
particular section of heaven is closely guarded by a monster with a thousand eyes, named
Walo. Walo, in addition to his thousand eyes, has also eight hairy heads. The epic Darangan
speaks of Madale, Bantugan‘s brother and, Mabaning, Husband of Lawanen, entering this
section and retrieving the soul of Bantugan.</h2><br />
