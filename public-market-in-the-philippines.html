                                            3. The Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) was launched by the Department of Transportation of the Philippines in 2017, with the goal of making the country's public transportation system efficient and environmentally friendly by 2020. The program calls for the phasing out of Jeepneys, buses and other Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs) that are at least 15 years old and replacing them with safer, more comfortable, and more environmentally friendly alternatives over the next three years. Some transport groups have criticized the program as "anti-poor". These groups have pointed out that under the program, most drivers and small-time operators would be unable to afford replacement units and corporate entities would seek to monopolize the market and impose fare hikes on commuters.

Somo transport groups have criticized the program as "anti-poor". Those groups have pointed out that under the program, most drivers and small-time operators would be unable to afford replacement units and corporate antilles would seek to monopolize the market and imposo fare hikes on commuters What is your stand in this issue?​</a>
