                                            TRUE OR FALSE1. Foundation is the part of the building below the surface of the ground which is sometimes called the substructure, 2. Footing is part of the foundation, 3. The topography of the surface does not affect the type and design of foundation, 4. For the building to last, its foundation should be designed for the worst times. 5. It is in pier foundation where concrete piers are carried down through the soil of inadequate bearing power until a satisfactory foundation bed is reached. 6. The portion of the foundation which directly distributes the weight of a building over large area is the column. 7. The foundation must be strong enough to support and distribute the load of the structure. 8. To anticipate the need for stepped footings, retaining walls, and problems related to the grade of the land, the plot plan and elevation plan drawings should also be examined. 9. The first thing to do in drafting foundation plan is to draw outlines of footings and columns based on accepted architectural drawing practices.10. The elements shown in every foundation plans vary depending on the type of foundation applied and the parts of the structure presented in the floor plan.​</a>

The Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Stomach, Small and Large intestines, Bones and Muscles. &gt;The Brain is the control center of the nervous system. There are billions of nerve cells in the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travel along nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions like contraction of the cardiac muscles. ''The three [ 3 ] main parts of the Brain are the Cerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem [ medulla oblongata, pons ]. Each part has particular functions. &gt;The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four [ 4 ] distributed within the lobes&gt;The Cerebellum is concerned with the maintenance of posture and balance, and the coordination of movements. &gt;The Brain stem has three parts, the medulla, pons, and midbrain. &gt;The Medulla controls the involuntary activities such as breathing and heart rate. &gt;The Pons connects the major motor and sensory nerves from the spinal cord, medulla and cerebellum with the midbrain and cerebrum. &gt;The Midbrain controls eye movements and size of pupils. It also coordinates head movement with isght and soundActivity No.2 Read and Answer1. How does the Brain work?A_____________B._____________C._____________D._____________B. The Heart is just as big as your fist. Its located in the thoracic cavity just behind the breastbone and between the lungs. It is hollow muscular organ. It's wall encloses four [ 4 ] chambers and the whole heart is enclosed in a sac called pericardium. It beats day and night without stopping and will continue to do so for as long as an individual lives. A healthy heart contracts about 75 times a minute or 4500 times an hour. &gt;Function of the heart:The heart is the pump that enables blood to circulate around the body. The automatic and rhythmic contraction of its muscles enables the body to meet its needs. It is an efficient machine that generates its own power for as long as it supplied with nutrients and energy.1. Describe how the Heart looks like?2. How does the Heart function?3. Where is the heart located?4. Which is the pumping organ of the body?5. How many heartbeats does the heart do in a minute?C. THE LUNGS are organs that supply oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. Lungs are made up mainly of epithelial tissue and connective tissue. In the Lungs, oxygen from the air and exhaled. The oxygen-rich blood cells is transported throughout the body. Activity No.1B.1.How does the Lungs work for the body? 2.What are the gases that are supplied to and removed from the blood? A.___________B.___________​3.What kind of tissues are the lungs made up?A.___________B.___________D.The Liver is the largest solid organ in the body. It is a four pound organ highly efficient chemical processing tissue that produces chemicals that flow into the small intestine to help in degistion. It removes toxin from the blood. It can be located by placing our left hand over our right , lowermost ribs, your hand covers the area of the liver.Without the liver, digestion will be impossible and the conversion on food into living cells and energy practically nonexistent. The liver function can be roughly divided into those that breakdown food molecules and those that build up or reconstitute these nutrients into a form that the body can use or store efficiently.Activity No.1A.

                                            2. What role do radioactive elements play in a nuclear power plant?a. Radioactive elements are the source of direct electrical energy in a nuclear power plantb. These elements undergo nuclear fission and give off enormous amounts of energy that isdirectly converted as electrical energyc. The heat coming from these radioactive elements is converted directly into electrical energyd. When these elements undergo nuclear fission, they release an enormous amount of heat thatboils water into steam. This steam enters into a turbine that converts mechanical energy intoelectrical3. What function do substations play in the transmission of electricity?a. These substations are the ones that directly distribute the electricity to housesb. These substations have step-down transformers that reduce the voltage of the electricity beforeit distributes it to housesc. These substations have step-up transformers that increase the voltage of the electricity beforeit travels through the transmission lines againd. The substations collect all the electricity from different sources and then redistribute them todifferent houses4. How are refrigerators and aircon unit similar?a. Both of these machines use work to transfer heat from a cold region to a hot regionb. Both of these machines are perfectly efficient and are able to do their functionc. Both of these machines use heat in order to do mechanical workd. Neither of these two operates at highly temperatures which make them highly efficient5. In buildings that are being electrically heated, is it at all wasteful to turn all the lights on?a. Yes, because the light's consume a lot of electrical energy thus you will have to pay more forthe energy consumedb. Yes, because these bulbs will become busted eventually and will have to be replaced from time to timec. No, because as stated in the first part of the statement, the building is being heated thus these light would contribute to heating the buildingd. No, because the light consume only a minimal amount of electrical energy thus it would not all be wastedful.​</a>

Footing is part of the foundation, 3. The topography of the surface does not affect the type and design of foundation, 4. For the building to last, its foundation should be designed for the worst times. 5. It is in pier foundation where concrete piers are carried down through the soil of inadequate bearing power until a satisfactory foundation bed is reached. 6. The portion of the foundation which directly distributes the weight of a building over large area is the column. 7. The foundation must be strong enough to support and distribute the load of the structure. 8. To anticipate the need for stepped footings, retaining walls, and problems related to the grade of the land, the plot plan and elevation plan drawings should also be examined. 9. The first thing to do in drafting foundation plan is to draw outlines of footings and columns based on accepted architectural drawing practices.10.

The Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Stomach, Small and Large intestines, Bones and Muscles. &gt;The Brain is the control center of the nervous system. There are billions of nerve cells in the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travel along nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions like contraction of the cardiac muscles. ''The three [ 3 ] main parts of the Brain are the Cerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem [ medulla oblongata, pons ]. Each part has particular functions. &gt;The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four [ 4 ] distributed within the lobes&gt;The Cerebellum is concerned with the maintenance of posture and balance, and the coordination of movements. &gt;The Brain stem has three parts, the medulla, pons, and midbrain. &gt;The Medulla controls the involuntary activities such as breathing and heart rate. &gt;The Pons connects the major motor and sensory nerves from the spinal cord, medulla and cerebellum with the midbrain and cerebrum. &gt;The Midbrain controls eye movements and size of pupils. It also coordinates head movement with isght and soundActivity No.2 Read and Answer1. How does the Brain work?A_____________B._____________C._____________D._____________B. The Heart is just as big as your fist. Its located in the thoracic cavity just behind the breastbone and between the lungs. It is hollow muscular organ. It's wall encloses four [ 4 ] chambers and the whole heart is enclosed in a sac called pericardium. It beats day and night without stopping and will continue to do so for as long as an individual lives. A healthy heart contracts about 75 times a minute or 4500 times an hour. &gt;Function of the heart:The heart is the pump that enables blood to circulate around the body. The automatic and rhythmic contraction of its muscles enables the body to meet its needs. It is an efficient machine that generates its own power for as long as it supplied with nutrients and energy.1. Describe how the Heart looks like?2. How does the Heart function?3. Where is the heart located?4. Which is the pumping organ of the body?5. How many heartbeats does the heart do in a minute?C. THE LUNGS are organs that supply oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. Lungs are made up mainly of epithelial tissue and connective tissue. In the Lungs, oxygen from the air and exhaled. The oxygen-rich blood cells is transported throughout the body. Activity No.1B.1.How does the Lungs work for the body? 2.What are the gases that are supplied to and removed from the blood? A.___________B.___________​3.What kind of tissues are the lungs made up?A.___________B.___________D.The Liver is the largest solid organ in the body. It is a four pound organ highly efficient chemical processing tissue that produces chemicals that flow into the small intestine to help in degistion. It removes toxin from the blood. It can be located by placing our left hand over our right , lowermost ribs, your hand covers the area of the liver.Without the liver, digestion will be impossible and the conversion on food into living cells and energy practically nonexistent. The liver function can be roughly divided into those that breakdown food molecules and those that build up or reconstitute these nutrients into a form that the body can use or store efficiently.Activity No.1A.

                            5. 2. What role do radioactive elements play in a nuclear power plant?a. Radioactive elements are the source of direct electrical energy in a nuclear power plantb. These elements undergo nuclear fission and give off enormous amounts of energy that isdirectly converted as electrical energyc. The heat coming from these radioactive elements is converted directly into electrical energyd. When these elements undergo nuclear fission, they release an enormous amount of heat thatboils water into steam. This steam enters into a turbine that converts mechanical energy intoelectrical3. What function do substations play in the transmission of electricity?a. These substations are the ones that directly distribute the electricity to housesb. These substations have step-down transformers that reduce the voltage of the electricity beforeit distributes it to housesc. These substations have step-up transformers that increase the voltage of the electricity beforeit travels through the transmission lines againd. The substations collect all the electricity from different sources and then redistribute them todifferent houses4. How are refrigerators and aircon unit similar?a. Both of these machines use work to transfer heat from a cold region to a hot regionb. Both of these machines are perfectly efficient and are able to do their functionc. Both of these machines use heat in order to do mechanical workd. Neither of these two operates at highly temperatures which make them highly efficient5. In buildings that are being electrically heated, is it at all wasteful to turn all the lights on?a. Yes, because the light's consume a lot of electrical energy thus you will have to pay more forthe energy consumedb. Yes, because these bulbs will become busted eventually and will have to be replaced from time to timec. No, because as stated in the first part of the statement, the building is being heated thus these light would contribute to heating the buildingd. No, because the light consume only a minimal amount of electrical energy thus it would not all be wastedful.​</h2><br />
