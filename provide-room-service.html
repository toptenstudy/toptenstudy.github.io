                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Room service or in-room dining is a hotel service enabling guests to choose items of food and drink for delivery to their hotel room for consumption. Room service is organised as a subdivision within the food and beverage department of high-end hotel and resort properties. It is uncommon for room service to be offered in hotels that are not high-end, or in motels. Room service may also be provided for guests on cruise ships.[1] Room service may be provided on a 24-hour basis or limited to late night hours only. Due to the cost of customized orders and delivery of room service, prices charged to the patron are typically much higher than in the hotel's restaurant or tuck shop, and a gratuity is expected.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>i</strong><strong> </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> </strong><strong>y</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>(</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>s</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>k</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>k</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>y</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>It is important to set proper expectations for guest. When they request specific housekeeping services, the housekeeping staff should inform the guest how much it will take to complete the request. It is because guests stay at the accommodation establishment to feel relaxed and be at home away from home, not to mention they are paying for what they expect to be excellent service. Oftentimes guests want to have the best experience and they have the right to have that. As housekeeping staff, it is a big responsibility to ensure that the guests are satisfied and contented with the standard of service provided, that is why proper expectations should be set.  </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
