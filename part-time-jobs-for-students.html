At the same time, as much as she wants to help the student body, she joined the council to add a position and experience to her curriculum vitae. Her mentality is that because of her service, she well be rewarded with occolades to help her land a job in the future. One day, she was faced with an ethical decision: as she was sorting paper work for the council to be submitted for approval, she saw a proposal made by her co-council member, James putting her only as a back-up not a part of organizing committee. She only needed one more project to lead in able to be awarded as the top student of the year. She decides to reprint the proposal, but this time indicating her as project lead. She forged the signature of the other signatories and submitted it to the student affair office. 1.1 Was this an ethical choice for martina? Why or why not?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Certainly! A resume is an essential tool for students to showcase their skills, education, and work experience when applying for internships, part-time jobs, or other opportunities. Here's a breakdown of the recommended resume format for a student:</p><p></p><p>1. Header: Your resume should start with a header that includes your name, contact information (e.g., phone number, email address), and optionally, a link to your professional online profile (such as LinkedIn).</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>John Smith</p><p>123 Main Street</p><p>Anytown, USA 12345</p><p>Phone: (555) 123-4567</p><p>Email: johnsmith@email.com</p><p>LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/johnsmith</p><p></p><p>2. Resume Objective: This is a brief statement that highlights your career goals and what you hope to achieve with the position you are applying for. Tailor this statement to the specific job or internship you are applying for and make it impactful.</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Objective: Seeking a challenging internship in software development to apply my programming skills and gain practical experience in developing innovative solutions for real-world problems.</p><p></p><p>3. Skills Section: List the relevant skills you possess that are applicable to the job or internship you are applying for. This could include technical skills, programming languages, software proficiency, and soft skills such as communication, leadership, and teamwork.</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Skills:</p><p>- Proficient in Java, C++, and Python programming languages</p><p>- Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms</p><p>- Experience with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p><p>- Excellent written and verbal communication skills</p><p>- Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment</p><p></p><p>4. Education: Include your current or most recent educational institution, degree earned or pursuing, major or field of study, and graduation date. You can also mention any relevant coursework, academic achievements, or extracurricular activities related to the job or internship you are applying for.</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Education:</p><p>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</p><p>XYZ University, Anytown, USA</p><p>Expected Graduation: May 2023</p><p>Relevant Coursework: Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Development, Database Management</p><p></p><p>5. Work/Project Experience: Highlight any relevant internships, part-time jobs, or projects you have worked on during your studies. Include the name of the organization or company, your role, the duration of your work, and a brief description of your responsibilities and achievements. Use action verbs and quantify the impact of your work whenever possible (e.g., increased website traffic by 30%, managed a team of 5 members, etc.).</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Work Experience:</p><p>Software Development Intern</p><p>ABC Tech, Anytown, USA</p><p>May 2022 - August 2022</p><p>- Assisted in the development of a mobile app using Java, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement</p><p>- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify and resolve software bugs and improve application performance</p><p></p><p>6. Optional Sections: Depending on your background and the job or internship you are applying for, you can include additional sections such as Awards and Honors, Leadership Experience, Volunteer Work, or Relevant Projects. Only include sections that are relevant and add value to your resume.</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Awards and Honors:</p><p>- Dean's List, XYZ University, Fall 2021</p><p>- Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science, XYZ University, Spring 2020</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
