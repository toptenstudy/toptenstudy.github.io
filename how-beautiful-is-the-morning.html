The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of "shining morning faces" and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling. 1. Cite evidence that Anne is a teacher. 2. Cite evidence that the setting is school. 3. Cite phrases from the text that the learners are well disciplined. 4.

"All Things Bright and Beautiful"
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them high and lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;−
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,−
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;−
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who hath made all things well.</a>

                                            In spring it is the dawn that is most beautiful. As the light creeps over the hills, their outlines are dyed a faint red and wisps of purplish cloud trail over them. 
In summer the nights. Not only when the moon shines, but on dark nights, too. As the fireflies fly to and fro, and even when it rains, how beautiful it is! 
In autumn the evenings, when the glittering sun sinks close to the edge of the hills and the crows fly back to their nests in threes, and fours, and twos; more charming still is a file of wild geese, like specks in the distant sky. When the sun has set, one’s heart is moved by the sound of the wind and the hum of the insects. 
In winter the early mornings. It is beautiful indeed when snow has fallen during the night, but splendid, too, when the ground is white with frost; or even when there is no snow or frost, but it is simply very cold and the attendants hurry from room to room stirring up the fires and bringing charcoal, how well this fits the season’s mood! But as noon approaches and the cold wears off, no one bothers to keep the braziers alight, and soon nothing remains but piles of white ashes.

On this Patriot's Day, like so many before, fans jumped onto the T to see the Sox at Fenway. In the grit and the human spirit and across this city, hundreds of thousands of Bostonians lined to hand the runners cups of water and to cheer them on. It was a beautiful day to be in Boston - a day that explains why a poet once wrote that this town is not just a capital, not just a place. Boston, he said, is the perfect state And then, in an instant, the day's beauty was shattered. A celebration became a tragedy. And so we come together to pray, and mour, and measure our loss. But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace - to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted, and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed. of grace." 1.

"All Things Bright and Beautiful"
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them high and lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;−
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,−
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;−
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who hath made all things well.</h2><br />

                            25. In spring it is the dawn that is most beautiful. As the light creeps over the hills, their outlines are dyed a faint red and wisps of purplish cloud trail over them. 
In summer the nights. Not only when the moon shines, but on dark nights, too. As the fireflies fly to and fro, and even when it rains, how beautiful it is! 
In autumn the evenings, when the glittering sun sinks close to the edge of the hills and the crows fly back to their nests in threes, and fours, and twos; more charming still is a file of wild geese, like specks in the distant sky. When the sun has set, one’s heart is moved by the sound of the wind and the hum of the insects. 
In winter the early mornings. It is beautiful indeed when snow has fallen during the night, but splendid, too, when the ground is white with frost; or even when there is no snow or frost, but it is simply very cold and the attendants hurry from room to room stirring up the fires and bringing charcoal, how well this fits the season’s mood! But as noon approaches and the cold wears off, no one bothers to keep the braziers alight, and soon nothing remains but piles of white ashes.

On this Patriot's Day, like so many before, fans jumped onto the T to see the Sox at Fenway. In the grit and the human spirit and across this city, hundreds of thousands of Bostonians lined to hand the runners cups of water and to cheer them on. It was a beautiful day to be in Boston - a day that explains why a poet once wrote that this town is not just a capital, not just a place. Boston, he said, is the perfect state And then, in an instant, the day's beauty was shattered. A celebration became a tragedy. And so we come together to pray, and mour, and measure our loss. But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace - to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted, and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed. of grace." 1.
