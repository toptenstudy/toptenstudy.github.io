D.A tranformer can function with either an alternating current (ac) or a steady direct current (dc)</h2><br />
                        <p>Among the four statement about transformer, the statement that is not correct is the statement in letter D.
</p><p>
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>  </p><p>Transformer, from its word, functions to “transform” voltage from higher to lower or vice versa. Step down transformer decreases high voltage into low voltage. Since it results is to the lower voltage hence, the current is increased. Thus statement A is correct. (see this link https://brainly.ph/question/1394688)
</p><p>Transformer uses the principle of electromagnetic induction which is govern by <strong>Faraday’s and Lenz Law</strong>. Thus statement in letter C is correct. (see this link https://brainly.ph/question/103829)
</p><p>The operation of transformer is through <strong>electromagnetic induction</strong> which is in the form of mutual induction. Mutual induction is when a coil of wire induces voltage through magnetism into another coil which is close to it. Thus statement in letter B is also correct. (see this link https://brainly.ph/question/424575)
</p><p>Statement in letter D is not correct because transformer can only use the magnetic flux of AC voltage to operate thus it cannot function with the steady DC voltage.  </p><br /><br />

                        Answer:<p></p><p><strong>D. A transformer can function with either an  alternating current (AC) or steady direct current (DC).</strong></p><p></p><p>The transformer should be an electrical component rather an electronic component. It is built so energy from one circuit can transfer to another circuit by means of magnetic coupling. It is a simple static electro-magnetic passive electrical device working on the principle of Faraday's law of induction. Alternating current (AC) creates magnetic flux in the core on the first winding, while inducing the voltage in the others. It can convert high and low voltages. However it cannot convert AC to DC. <strong>In Direct current or DC supply, there is no inductance, only resistance will act in the circuit.</strong></p><p></p><p>AC and DC in electricity:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/532625</p><p></p><p>Difference between direct current and alternating current:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/793690</p><p></p><p>Advantage of alternating current:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2055363</p><p></p><p><strong>Code: 10.22.2.1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Faraday's laws of electromagnetic induction.</p><p>(a) First law : Whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux associated with a circuit, an e.m.f. is induced in the circuit.</p><p>(b) Second law : The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.</p><p>Lenz law : The direction of induced current is such as to oppose the change that produces it</p><p></p><p>Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, also known as Faraday's law, is the basic law of electromagnetism which helps us to predict how a magnetic field would interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (EMF). This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hopes it helps... correct me if I'm wrong</p><p></p><br />
