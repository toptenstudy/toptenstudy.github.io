The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                            15. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.
