                        Researchers say that animals, non-humans, do not have a true language like humans. However they do communicate with each other through sounds and gestures. Animals have a number of in-born qualities they use to signal their feelings, but these are not like the formed words we see in the human language. Human children show these same forms of communication as babies when crying and gesturing. But they slowly learn the words of the language and use this as form of communication.<p></p><br />
