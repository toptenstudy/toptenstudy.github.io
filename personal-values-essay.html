As time passes I also realized the importance of many other things that surrounds me apart from my books. Then it came the time when I have to depart my home from higher education to pursue my graduate degree at Stanford College. At that time I was totally amused with the world outside my books where people are interacting with each other for ages. Then in the same year, an epiphany moment happened to me when I found my second love after books that are for the Animals. I used to communicate with them for hours and hours and tried to understand their emotions. This was the turning point of my life that raised my love for Animals to a huge account. After my College get completed a teaching job becomes a golden opportunity for me that I wanted to pursue from my childhood. It was like a dream comes true.

                        Work can be defined as an activity that involves physical or mental effort to accomplish a task or goal. It may be paid or unpaid, and it could range from manual labor to professional services. Work can be seen as a fundamental aspect of human life, as it enables individuals to achieve their goals and provide for their needs and wants.Valuing one's own work is important because it fosters a sense of self-worth, dignity, and purpose. It allows a person to take pride in their accomplishments and to recognize the effort and time that they have invested in their work. When one values their own work, they are motivated to improve their skills, increase their productivity, and strive for excellence.Developing desirable work habits or values is crucial to achieving success and personal fulfillment. Some of these habits include punctuality, reliability, dedication, initiative, and accountability. Punctuality means showing up on time and respecting other people's time. Reliability involves keeping promises and meeting deadlines. Dedication means being committed to one's work and giving it the necessary time and effort. Initiative involves being proactive and taking the lead when necessary. Accountability involves taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions.Time management refers to the process of planning, organizing, and controlling one's time to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency. It involves prioritizing tasks, setting goals, and allocating time effectively to accomplish them. Effective time management enables individuals to accomplish more in less time and to reduce stress and anxiety caused by a lack of time.Time is a crucial resource that is directly related to productivity. Effective time management allows individuals to prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently, which results in increased productivity. When time is managed well, individuals can accomplish more in less time and reduce the risk of burnout and stress caused by overwork.Some instances where one can save time and energy at home include creating a cleaning schedule, preparing meals in advance, organizing household items, and automating tasks such as bill payments and laundry.Project-making is important in daily life because it helps individuals to accomplish their goals and achieve their desired outcomes. Projects provide a structured approach to achieving complex tasks and enable individuals to break them down into manageable steps. By completing projects, individuals can gain a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction.Setting objectives before beginning a project is important because it provides a clear direction and purpose for the project. Objectives help individuals to focus their efforts and prioritize their tasks, which reduces the risk of wasted time and resources. Objectives also enable individuals to measure their progress and evaluate their success in achieving their goals.<p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

                        Personal Experiences and Sociological Imagination<p></p>Think about the decisions you will need to make when applying to colleges. I might believe that this is a lonely journey because you have to ace the exams and write outstanding college application essays. But is it really such a lonely path? Forget the obvious fact that millions of other people are also engaging in it. When I consider my family, friends, and teachers at school, even your particular predicament is bigger than my surrounding environment.<p></p>SOCIOLOGICAL IMAGINATION REGARDING TO COLLEGE APPLICATIONSThe idea that my college decisions should be viewed as a singular experience can readily be dismantled by sociological imagination. The same is true for decisions I make regarding other aspects of education, such as whether I'll live on campus or off, or I'll join school organizations or clubs. <p></p>There are plenty of expectations for me individually.  Also, the constant pressure from my family and my teachers that I will get into good universities. In our society, it's very difficult to study what you are most interested in because of it being unpopular or not being regarded well such Sciences and Arts. There isn't money in it and are not seen as important. We cannot also ignore the insulting stereotypes like for example if I want to study Psychology, because of the ignorance about it, they would mock you for it. <p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17760790</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5456310</p><p></p><p></p><br />
