The first school of any person is his/her home and the family is said to be the first teacher. Education is that weapon, with the help of which one can face the biggest difficulties. Without education we cannot do any Work Well, education is useful in every area of our life. Good Education helps in removing all the differences of the society.

                                            Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic</a>

Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below.

                                            Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.i
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic...</a>

                                            PA ANS PO TAMA PLSSSSSSSSSWho was Plato?The ancient Greek philosopher Plato was a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle. His writings make up some of the most fundamental texts of Greek philosophy, and concern justice, beauty, equality, politics, theology, cosmology, epistemology and the philosophy of language. It is believed that Plato was born into the Greek aristocracy around 428 B.C. He was probably taught by some of Athens' finest educators. Two major events in his youth set him on a course for life. The first was meeting the great Greek philosopher Socrates, whose methods of dialogue and debate impressed Plato so much that he became very close to Socrates, and dedicated his life to the questions of virtue and how one could form a noble character. Then second major event was the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Plato served in this war for about 5 years. With Athens’ defeat came the defeat of its democracy, which the Spartans replaced with an oligarchy. When the oligarchy was overthrown and democracy was restored, Plato considered a career in politics, but Socrates’ execution in 399 B.C. convinced him instead to pursue a life of study and philosophy.  For 12 years after Socrates's death, Plato traveled. He studied mathematics with the Pythagoreans in Italy, and geometry, geology, astronomy and religion in Egypt. It is during this time that he began to write the dialogues with which we are familiar today. With a goal of providing a place for future leaders to discover how to build a better government in the Greek city‐states, Plato founded a school known as the Academy around 385 B.C. He was its leader for the rest of his life. Its curriculum included astronomy, biology, mathematics, political theory and philosophy.</a>

Teenagepregnancy rates were higher in the 1950s than they are today. However, a higher Proportion of teenage motherswere married (primarily due to "shotgun weddings," a Colloquialism that developed from the idea that many fathersof pregnant girls had to force, Possibly with a weapon, a man to marry his daughter once she became pregnant).Many families were unable to survive the traumas of war and its aftermath, and the divorce rate rose from one in sixin 1940 to one in four marriages in 1946. Although many families prospered in the years following World War II, manyothers suffered from economic hardship. In 1948, Newsweek reported that most of the 27 million school children inthe United States were severely in need of medical or dental care, while more than 900 thousand children weremalnourished.- Kunz, THINK Marriages &amp; Families, p.8a. teenage pregnancy ratesb. the effect of war on divorcec. family problems in the 1950sd.golden age​</a>

                                            Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic..</a>

Education is the word that teaches a person to live life. Education is the basis of human life. Education should be equal for both men and women because both together can make a healthy and educated Society. Education is a weapon to improve one's life. It is probably the most important tool to change one's life.    Education improves one's knowledge, skills, personality and attitude. The first school of any person is his/her home and the family is said to be the first teacher. Education is that weapon, with the help of which one can face the biggest difficulties. Without education we cannot do any Work Well, education is useful in every area of our life. Good Education helps in removing all the differences of the society.

                            9. Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic</h2><br />

Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness.

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below.

                            19. PA ANS PO TAMA PLSSSSSSSSSWho was Plato?The ancient Greek philosopher Plato was a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle. His writings make up some of the most fundamental texts of Greek philosophy, and concern justice, beauty, equality, politics, theology, cosmology, epistemology and the philosophy of language. It is believed that Plato was born into the Greek aristocracy around 428 B.C. He was probably taught by some of Athens' finest educators. Two major events in his youth set him on a course for life. The first was meeting the great Greek philosopher Socrates, whose methods of dialogue and debate impressed Plato so much that he became very close to Socrates, and dedicated his life to the questions of virtue and how one could form a noble character. Then second major event was the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Plato served in this war for about 5 years. With Athens’ defeat came the defeat of its democracy, which the Spartans replaced with an oligarchy. When the oligarchy was overthrown and democracy was restored, Plato considered a career in politics, but Socrates’ execution in 399 B.C. convinced him instead to pursue a life of study and philosophy.  For 12 years after Socrates's death, Plato traveled. He studied mathematics with the Pythagoreans in Italy, and geometry, geology, astronomy and religion in Egypt. It is during this time that he began to write the dialogues with which we are familiar today. With a goal of providing a place for future leaders to discover how to build a better government in the Greek city‐states, Plato founded a school known as the Academy around 385 B.C. He was its leader for the rest of his life. Its curriculum included astronomy, biology, mathematics, political theory and philosophy.</h2><br />

                            23. 11. You've probably heard that older men die before older women virtually everywhere in the World. In the UnitedStates, women are expected to live an average of 80.4 years, while men live only 75.2 years. Sociologists attributemany factors to this trend. For example, men have higher testosterone levels than women, making men more likelyto abuse alcohol and Tobacco, drive aggressively, and engage in other life-threatening behaviors. Men also chooseRiskier types of work and become involved in wartime aggression connected to men's decreased life expectancy.Studies also show that women are less likely to experience life-Threatening illnesses and health problems than menare.-Carl, Think Sociology, p. 211a. women's healthb. men and risky behaviorsC.

Teenagepregnancy rates were higher in the 1950s than they are today. However, a higher Proportion of teenage motherswere married (primarily due to "shotgun weddings," a Colloquialism that developed from the idea that many fathersof pregnant girls had to force, Possibly with a weapon, a man to marry his daughter once she became pregnant).Many families were unable to survive the traumas of war and its aftermath, and the divorce rate rose from one in sixin 1940 to one in four marriages in 1946. Although many families prospered in the years following World War II, manyothers suffered from economic hardship. In 1948, Newsweek reported that most of the 27 million school children inthe United States were severely in need of medical or dental care, while more than 900 thousand children weremalnourished.- Kunz, THINK Marriages &amp; Families, p.8a. teenage pregnancy ratesb. the effect of war on divorcec. family problems in the 1950sd.golden age​</h2><br />

                            30. Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic..</h2><br />
