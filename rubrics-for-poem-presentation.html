Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why?

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>An earthquake is sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in rocks, called the elastic rebound theory. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Each year there are more than 150,000 earthquakes strong enough to be felt by people and 900,000 recorded by seismometers!</p><p></p><p>In an earthquake, the initial point where the rocks rupture in the crust is called the focus (sometimes called the hypocenter). The epicenter is the point on the land surface that is directly above the focus. In about 75% of earthquakes, the focus is in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage because the focus is near where people live. However, it is the epicenter of an earthquake that is reported by scientists and the media.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>Let's look at three examples of axiomatic systems for a collection of committees selected</strong></p><p><strong>from a set of people. In each case, determine whether the axiomatic system is consistent or</strong></p><p><strong>inconsistent. If it is consistent, determine whether the system is independent or redundant,</strong></p><p><strong>complete or incomplete.</strong></p><p><strong>1. (a) There is a  nite number of people.</strong></p><p><strong>(b) Each committee consists of exactly two people.</strong></p><p><strong>(c) Exactly one person is on an odd number of committees.</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: This axiomatic system is inconsistent. In fact, we can prove that the  rst</strong></p><p><strong>two axioms imply that the number of people on an odd number of committees must</strong></p><p><strong>be even. This is sometimes called the Handshaking Theorem because it is often stated</strong></p><p><strong>in the form of pairs of people shaking hands (rather than serving on committees).</strong></p><p><strong>Handshaking Theorem: If various pairs of people among a  nite number</strong></p><p><strong>of people shake hands, the number of people who shake hands an odd number</strong></p><p><strong>of times is even.</strong></p><p><strong>Proof: Assume that there are n people. Let ai denote the number of times individual</strong></p><p><strong>i shakes hands, i = 1;:::;n. Let K denote the total number of handshakes that take</strong></p><p><strong>place. Then a1 + a2 +  + an = 2K because every handshake is counted twice when</strong></p><p><strong>we add up the number of handshakes for each individual. Now 2K is an even number,</strong></p><p><strong>so the sum a1 + a2 +  + an must be even.

Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>REFLECTION ESSAY
</p><p>As I sit down to reflect on my time in the English major at Berry, I’m roughly three 
</p><p>months removed from my last English class. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a semester-
</p><p>long student teaching experience at Armuchee High School, finishing out my Secondary 
</p><p>Education minor and preparing for the “real world” of teaching that awaits me after May 10th
</p><p>. 
</p><p>At this point, I’ve got some well-needed temporal, as well as practical, distance between myself 
</p><p>and the English classes that were a staple of my time at Berry. Truth be told, I miss them. On a 
</p><p>more relevant note, I’m thankful for them. In combination with my own extensive 
</p><p>extracurricular studies of literature – e.g. my annual summer reading and research projects 
</p><p>with books like Ulysses, Gravity’s Rainbow, and Infinite Jest – my English studies at Berry have 
</p><p>not only given me knowledge that I am using right now in the high school classroom but also 
</p><p>made me an overall better, more critical reader and writer. The discussions I’ve had (or rather, 
</p><p>given my introverted nature, mostly observed) in class have shown me how to engage with 
</p><p>others in good intellectual discussion and how a single text can be approached and analyzed 
</p><p>from a variety of angles. The connections I’ve made with professors, both in and out of the 
</p><p>classroom, have shown me much the same while giving me intellectual and personal role 
</p><p>models to look up to. In short, my experience as an English major at Berry has been an 
</p><p>enriching one, one that has prepared me both professionally and personally for the years after 
</p><p>graduation.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> i hope it help</p><p></p><br />
