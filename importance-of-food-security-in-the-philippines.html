(the photo is the criteria) Philippines' latest response to the pandemic by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020) The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country. The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</a>

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                                            who to make it shorter
Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</a>

Philippines' latest response to the pandemic
by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country.
The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.
Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Food Security is Important </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Philippines as an agricultural country should achieve food safety and security and must be self-sufficient. Agriculture have been said to be the backbone of nation building but agriculture sector in the country  have been long neglected because large corporations and oligarchs developed and converted agricultural lands into industrial and housing business. During Marcos era, Philippine agriculture reached its peak for the former President Ferdinand Marcos established the so called International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Baños, Laguna that leads for research and development of new variety of rice. IRRI is responsible for the development of rice sector that contributed to the food sufficiency in the country. Neighboring countries suxh as Vietnam and Thailand were able to send their people to IRRI to learn new skills and technique to improve their agriculture. Now, Philippines is a major importer of rice and other food commodities from this country. It is so sad that the Philippines with vast area for agriculture is a major importer of rice. The Rice Tarrification Law has added burden to Filipino farmers where it allows the proliferation of imported rice in the market but do not help stabilize the price of palay and rice. </p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p><p></p> Sustainable development should be prudently implemented or practiced by countries around the world for it satisfies the future generations and compromising the ability to meet the future needs of the nation.

                            6. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                            9. who to make it shorter
Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</h2><br />

Philippines' latest response to the pandemic
by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country.
The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.
Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</h2><br />
                        OPINION ESSAY PARAGRAPH<p></p>Philippines' Latest Response to the Pandemic<p></p><p>In my opinion, the <strong>Philippine government's response</strong> to the COVID-19 pandemic has been effective in addressing the vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic in the country's economy, healthcare system, and food security. The establishment of the <strong>One Command Hospital Center (OCHC)</strong>, for example, is a valuable initiative that will help to improve coordination between private and public hospitals, which is essential in addressing the pandemic. Additionally, the government's efforts to increase testing capacity and contract tracing are crucial in containing <strong>the spread of the virus</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, the passage of the Bayanihan Act 2 into law demonstrates the government's commitment to <strong>providing support</strong> and resources to those affected by the pandemic. The extension of the "state of calamity" until September 2021 is also a wise move, as it gives the government more time to marshal its resources and better address the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p><p>Overall, the Philippine government's response to<strong> the COVID-19 </strong>pandemic appears to be <strong>well-planned</strong> and well-coordinated. While the pandemic has exposed <strong>significant vulnerabilities</strong> in the country, the government's initiatives have demonstrated its commitment to addressing these issues and mitigating the impact of the pandemic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Opinion Paragraphs here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9172033</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />
