It is the process by which young people are enabled to take ownership of their own lives, their own future, and to change the conditions in which they live.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Home » Subject » Essay » The youth today - are they more impatient than a few decades ago.</p><p>It has been rightly said that we spend the first half of our lives trying to understand the older generation, and the rest half in understanding the younger generation. Every age has its own charm. Youth has always felt somewhat exasperated with age and age has always been suspicious of youth. With their natural ebullience and impatience, a majority of young people are keen to act and learn on their own rather being guided by the experience of elders. The older people being more at home with words rather than action often make noises about the youth being impatient and rude. In every generation, old men are found to shaking their hoary heads and waxing nostalgic about the good old days when youth of their time knew better and showed due reverence to age and tradition.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope help</p><p></p>#<strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><p></p><p><strong>pa </strong><strong>MARK </strong><strong>BRIANLIST</strong><strong> po</strong></p><p><strong>thanks</strong><strong> again</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            8. the youth should be in school essay ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is a fundamental right for every individual, and it plays a crucial role in shaping one's future. The youth, being the future of the world, should be in school. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why the youth should be in school</p><p></p><p>Firstly, education provides young people with the necessary knowledge and skills that are essential for their personal and professional growth. A school is a place where children can acquire fundamental skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. They also learn about science, history, social studies, and other subjects that contribute to their intellectual development. These skills and knowledge are critical in preparing the youth for future careers and personal success.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, schools provide an environment that encourages social interaction and networking among young people. In school, children interact with peers from different backgrounds and learn how to develop relationships with people from diverse cultures. This exposure to different ideas, beliefs, and perspectives enables them to build a strong sense of community and respect for others, which is essential in building a more tolerant and peaceful society.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, being in school provides the youth with a structured routine and discipline. Schools have rules and regulations that promote discipline and structure in the daily lives of young people. This routine helps young people to develop good habits such as time management, punctuality, and responsibility, which are essential in building a successful career and personal life.</p><p>Lastly, education is essential in promoting economic development. Education is a key driver of economic growth and development, as it provides the necessary skills and knowledge that contribute to innovation, technological advancements, and productivity. Education also increases the earning potential of individuals, which contributes to their economic well-being and that of their families and communities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, education is a fundamental right for every individual, and the youth should be in school. Education provides young people with the necessary knowledge and skills that are essential for their personal and professional growth. It also provides an environment that encourages social interaction and networking among young people. Education promotes discipline, structure, and routine, which are essential in building a successful career and personal life. Finally, education is essential in promoting economic growth and development. Therefore, governments, parents, and all stakeholders must work together to ensure that the youth receive quality education that prepares them for the future.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ur welcome paki brainlist </p><br />
