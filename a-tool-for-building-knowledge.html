                                            Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</a>

The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3.

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</a>

                            8. Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</h2><br />

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane?

Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</h2><br />
