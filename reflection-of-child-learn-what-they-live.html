                            3. Additional ActivitiesHave you heard about the “feral children"? These are children found livingalone, usually in the wild, without humans taking care of them. For those found inthe forests, some say that animals took care and raised the children. Maybe you haveseen the movie Tarzan or heard of the character Mowgli from The Jungle Book. Theyare examples of feral children that were eventually brought back to society.Do you think humans can really live outside of society? Imagine being raisedby an animal. What would happen when, after long years of living with animals, aperson is placed in society? What would be the challenges? Do you think that personcould forget what he "learned" from the animals?Think and try to imagine the situation of a feral child. Write your thoughts orreflections about the questions about.pa helppp namn po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, human can live outside the society if their needs are being taken care of. Human raised by animal would be ignoramus. In my opinion, if a feral child would be brought back in the society it might cause him psychological problems. The feral child's animal-like behavior, inability to communicate verbally because of being isolated from human would be a challenge. A feral child's animalistic behavior would be imprinted on him/her forever. Once a feral child's been taken care by people it would change him/her over the time and can even learn how to live a normal life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. the pregnancy related problems are her child is underweight and have several problems.(not sure)</p><p>2.If she go to an ob-gyne or in a hospital she might know her child health issues and know on what she have to eat or do to to prevent that from happening.</p><p>3.I think DOH because it is an agency that take care of a person's health.</p><p>4.No. I dont support it because in teenage pregnancy she might get a lot of problems like financial.She might not finish her studies because she's already pregnant.</p><p>5.She might not find a decent job because she's just a teenager.</p><p>6. Maybe right age to get pregnat is around 26 above because she's already mature to handle things jyst like pregnancy. But for me I will just get pregnant if a already finish my studies,have a good job and pay,have my own house because it is better to have a child if you have already the things that the child needs.</p><p>7.
