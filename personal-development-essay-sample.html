                                            English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</a>

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

                            2. English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</h2><br />

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.
