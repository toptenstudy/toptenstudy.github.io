In plants known as "four o'clock", the allele for the dominant red flower color is designated as F and is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers f. A horticulturist allows several heterozygous pink flowered four o'clock to self-pollinate and collects 200 seeds.Draw a Punnett square for the cross and then identify the flower color phenotypes and theoretical percentage, and number of plants expected from these seeds.2. R is the allele for red color and W is allele for white color. Two pink rose flower plants were crossed.a. Using the Punnett square, show the possible outcome of the crossbetween two pink rose flower plants. b. Now, another cross was made involving a red rose flower plant and pink flower rose plant.Guide questions:1. How many types of gametes will each parent produce in problem no. A and B?2. What is the phenotype of a heterozygous rose plant.3. What are the possible phenotypes of the offspring from the cross of the parental plants?4.
