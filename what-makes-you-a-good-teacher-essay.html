Who do you think would benefit from these speeches in particular? Be able to explain your answer.1.All of those nights we spent cramming for the test the next morning, all of the books we read and the essays we wrote, all of the lessons we learned from not only our teachers, but our friends as well, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrrible experiences we have had throughout high school and the other years we spent in K-12 education have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast.2.No man is an island. Everyone needs someone to depend on. Nobody can live without the help of each other. Be good and be friendly.3.Life is beautiful. Sulking will not do you good. It would just make you sad. Go out and explore the beauty of surroundings. Again, life is beautiful to waste it crying over unimportant things.4.Supressing your anger is not good for any person. It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it. This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</a>

                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

Fina considera seeking the advice of someone who should be informing her about the right thing to do before she makes a decision.Guide Question:If you were consulted by Fina, what would you advice her ?  why?NOTE : ESSAY TYPE ANSWER​</h2><br />
                        <p>If Fina consulted me about the ethical implications of the dean's proposal to copy books for students, my advice would be to carefully consider the potential consequences of this decision.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Fina needs to review any legal implications of copying and selling books, especially if there are any copyright or intellectual property rights involved. She needs to make sure that she is not violating any laws and regulations by taking on this project.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Fina needs to consider the impact of this decision on her reputation and that of her business. Copying and selling books to students may be viewed as unethical by some people, especially if it is perceived as taking advantage of students who are already struggling financially. This may lead to negative publicity, loss of customers, and ultimately, damage to her business.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, Fina should assess the financial implications of this proposal. While the proposal may generate significant profits, it may also require additional investment in equipment, labor, and other resources. She needs to ensure that the profits outweigh the costs and that the investment is worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Fina should evaluate the long-term consequences of this decision. Is this proposal in line with her business goals and values? Will it create sustainable growth and opportunities for her business? Will it align with the interests and needs of her customers?</p><br />

                            9. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10. Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</h2><br />
