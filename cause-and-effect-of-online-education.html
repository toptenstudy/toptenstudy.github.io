Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

                                            find the title. Social media has become an integral part of the daily lives of many adolescents. While social media has numerous advantages, it can also have negative effects on adolescents. This report will highlight some of the positive and negative effects of social media on adolescents. Positive Effects of Social Media on Adolescents: Social media provides adolescents with an opportunity to connect and communicate with friends and family members. Social media can enhance adolescents' knowledge about a wide range of topics, including news, culture, and world events. Social media provides a platform for adolescents to express their opinions and engage in discussions about various issues. Social media can help adolescents develop their creative skills, such as photography, video editing, and writing. Negative Effects of Social Media on Adolescents: Social media can lead to cyberbullying, which can have a significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of adolescents. Social media can lead to addiction, as adolescents can become too attached to their devices and the online world, leading to neglect of their responsibilities and relationships. Social media can expose adolescents to inappropriate content, which can be harmful and may have a negative impact on their values and beliefs. Social media can cause anxiety, stress, and depression among adolescents, as they may feel pressure to maintain a perfect image online and keep up with their peers. Conclusion: Overall, social media has both positive and negative effects on adolescents. As such, parents, educators, and policymakers should be aware of the effects of social media on adolescents and take steps to mitigate the negative effects while promoting the positive ones. Adolescents themselves should also be taught to use social media responsibly, to ensure that they get the most out of it while avoiding its negative effectsplease  ​</a>

For several months now, our government together with the rest of the world, has
been planning counter-measures in defeating the
 unseen threat. However, our country
and the world at large are still in dilemma brought about by this Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Philippines, this health crisis has resulted to a major transition especially in
the field of education. One notable effect of this crisis is the adoption of different learning
modalities suited to the context of the school. Similarly, this crisis has caused the public
to express various opinions. Some expressed their disapproval to the new manner of
learning and claimed that many Filipinos are not yet ready to the newly-introduced
modalities such as online classes and blended learning. For them, effective learning
requires real interaction among the teachers and learners. In contrast to this, a certain
author asserted that face-to face learning is NOT necessary in the teaching and learning
process.</a>

They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc.

No face-to-face classes until Covid-19 vaccine is available (By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz June 8, 2020, 2:09 pm) MANILA – Students will remain at home indefinitely after the Department of Education (DepEd) announced its compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte’s order to suspend face-to-face classes until a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is available. In a statement, DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones thanked Duterte for supporting DepEd’s endeavor to offer alternative learning methods in light of the public health situation caused by the disease. While preparing schools for “a different setup” is a challenge, she said DepEd is readying the resumption of school operations based on their Basic Education — Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) which would affect almost the entire education infrastructure in the country — from the DepEd Central Office down to the school level. “We are updating our policies, realigning our finances, and collaborating with our partners so that our goals of providing quality education and protecting the safety and health of our constituents will be achieved,” Briones said. Remote enrollment is ongoing nationwide with the aim of collecting and assessing household information of students. The enrollment will be crucial in preparing and tailor-fitting the learning delivery method in different localities, Briones said. Meanwhile, the groundwork for “blended learning” is underway, which would make use of radio, television, online, and modular learning — currently being prepared and updated by the DepEd this year. “At the same time, teachers are being trained on utilizing newer platforms and innovative tools to aid their professional development,” Briones said. To ensure the effectiveness of these alternative learning methods, she said the DepEd is working with the private sector and education experts to make the necessary steps “logically sound, especially on the development, acquisition and deployment of learning resources.” For the duration of its implementation of the BE-LCP, she said the DepEd would provide regular assessment reports to the public which it previously committed to the House of Representatives. Last week, the DepEd announced that a total of 5,204,949 students have enrolled in both public and private schools nationwide during the first week of its remote enrollment system. The enrollment, which is for school year 2020-2021, is done through the phone or through online platforms and will last until June 30. (PNA) ​</a>

An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />

The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />

Social media can help adolescents develop their creative skills, such as photography, video editing, and writing. Negative Effects of Social Media on Adolescents: Social media can lead to cyberbullying, which can have a significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of adolescents. Social media can lead to addiction, as adolescents can become too attached to their devices and the online world, leading to neglect of their responsibilities and relationships. Social media can expose adolescents to inappropriate content, which can be harmful and may have a negative impact on their values and beliefs. Social media can cause anxiety, stress, and depression among adolescents, as they may feel pressure to maintain a perfect image online and keep up with their peers. Conclusion: Overall, social media has both positive and negative effects on adolescents. As such, parents, educators, and policymakers should be aware of the effects of social media on adolescents and take steps to mitigate the negative effects while promoting the positive ones. Adolescents themselves should also be taught to use social media responsibly, to ensure that they get the most out of it while avoiding its negative effectsplease  ​</h2><br />

                            23. Let's EVALUATE 1. Distance learning is any learning that happens without the learne being physically present to do or study the lesson. Learners m communicate with their teachers through mail or electronic mail. This a big help in education because learners can continue their education especially in this time of pandemic. The learning will never stop because of the distance learning.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc. Venn Diagramd. Cause and Effect Charte. Problem Solution2.

No face-to-face classes until Covid-19 vaccine is available (By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz June 8, 2020, 2:09 pm) MANILA – Students will remain at home indefinitely after the Department of Education (DepEd) announced its compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte’s order to suspend face-to-face classes until a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is available. In a statement, DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones thanked Duterte for supporting DepEd’s endeavor to offer alternative learning methods in light of the public health situation caused by the disease. While preparing schools for “a different setup” is a challenge, she said DepEd is readying the resumption of school operations based on their Basic Education — Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) which would affect almost the entire education infrastructure in the country — from the DepEd Central Office down to the school level. “We are updating our policies, realigning our finances, and collaborating with our partners so that our goals of providing quality education and protecting the safety and health of our constituents will be achieved,” Briones said. Remote enrollment is ongoing nationwide with the aim of collecting and assessing household information of students. The enrollment will be crucial in preparing and tailor-fitting the learning delivery method in different localities, Briones said. Meanwhile, the groundwork for “blended learning” is underway, which would make use of radio, television, online, and modular learning — currently being prepared and updated by the DepEd this year. “At the same time, teachers are being trained on utilizing newer platforms and innovative tools to aid their professional development,” Briones said. To ensure the effectiveness of these alternative learning methods, she said the DepEd is working with the private sector and education experts to make the necessary steps “logically sound, especially on the development, acquisition and deployment of learning resources.” For the duration of its implementation of the BE-LCP, she said the DepEd would provide regular assessment reports to the public which it previously committed to the House of Representatives. Last week, the DepEd announced that a total of 5,204,949 students have enrolled in both public and private schools nationwide during the first week of its remote enrollment system. The enrollment, which is for school year 2020-2021, is done through the phone or through online platforms and will last until June 30. (PNA) ​</h2><br />
