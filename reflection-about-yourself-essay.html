Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why? You may present your answer in creative way, e.g., using infographic, slogan, poster, 4-linepoem, essay, 4-line song or any presentation at your preference.Rubric5 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts and has no misconception.4 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts but with misconception.3 - Ideas are expressed scientifically but contains several contradictory concepts.2 - Ideas are poorly expressed scientifically.1 - Ideas are vague and unprecise.Note: Score is multiplied by 2Need ko po talaga please help me!​</a>

 Your goal is to write a reflective essay expressing your appreciation to the struggles of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization which helped you develop your sense of nationalism.
Role: You are a Filipino student.
Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</a>

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why? You may present your answer in creative way, e.g., using infographic, slogan, poster, 4-linepoem, essay, 4-line song or any presentation at your preference.Rubric5 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts and has no misconception.4 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts but with misconception.3 - Ideas are expressed scientifically but contains several contradictory concepts.2 - Ideas are poorly expressed scientifically.1 - Ideas are vague and unprecise.Note: Score is multiplied by 2Need ko po talaga please help me!​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The module as a whole has enabled me to look further into specific areas which are of interest to me &amp; those I did not have high confidence in delivering within the classroom. Working with others during the inputs has enabled me to further develop my communication skills as well as skills such as listening and empathy. Furthermore, working with others on some of the tasks has made the experience more enjoyable. The motivation &amp; encouragement we provided to each other was invaluable. I feel I have learnt a lot from them as professionals, sharing ideas and thoughts about many different issues – seeing different perspectives and encouraging me to develop my own thinking.</p><p></p><p>Throughout this 1st semester, I have enjoyed the HWB module. It has been good to develop my knowledge &amp; understanding in each of the different areas within HWB and also with some aspects relating to my ongoing thesis, it has enabled me to make connections and hopefully deepen my discussions later.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>yan? </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As I sit down to reflect on my time in the English major at Berry, I’m roughly three
</p><p>months removed from my last English class. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a semesterlong student teaching experience at Armuchee High School, finishing out my Secondary
</p><p>Education minor and preparing for the “real world” of teaching that awaits me after May 10th
</p><p>.
</p><p>At this point, I’ve got some well-needed temporal, as well as practical, distance between myself
</p><p>and the English classes that were a staple of my time at Berry. Truth be told, I miss them. On a
</p><p>more relevant note, I’m thankful for them. In combination with my own extensive
</p><p>extracurricular studies of literature – e.g. my annual summer reading and research projects
</p><p>with books like Ulysses, Gravity’s Rainbow, and Infinite Jest – my English studies at Berry have
</p><p>not only given me knowledge that I am using right now in the high school classroom but also
</p><p>made me an overall better, more critical reader and writer. The discussions I’ve had (or rather,
</p><p>given my introverted nature, mostly observed) in class have shown me how to engage with
</p><p>others in good intellectual discussion and how a single text can be approached and analyzed
</p><p>from a variety of angles. The connections I’ve made with professors, both in and out of the
</p><p>classroom, have shown me much the same while giving me intellectual and personal role
</p><p>models to look up to. In short, my experience as an English major at Berry has been an
</p><p>enriching one, one that has prepared me both professionally and personally for the years after
</p><p>graduation.
</p><p>Coming to Berry in the fall of 2010, I knew from the start that I was going to be an

 Your goal is to write a reflective essay expressing your appreciation to the struggles of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization which helped you develop your sense of nationalism.
Role: You are a Filipino student.
Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</h2><br />

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?
