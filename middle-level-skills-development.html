                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>

                            3. Using Rational Choice, explain which of the four (4) K-12 exits(higher education, entrepreneurship, employment, or middle-levelskills development) you plan to pursue and why. Write the Pros andCons, your decision, and the tradeoff.please help me​</h2><br />
                        Rational Choice theory suggests that individuals make decisions based on their rational self-interest and that they weigh the costs and benefits of each option before making a decision. Using this framework, I will evaluate the four K-12 exits and choose which one I plan to pursue.<br /><br />1. Higher Education: Pursuing higher education is a popular choice for students who want to specialize in a particular field and acquire advanced skills and knowledge. The Pros of pursuing higher education are that it can lead to better job opportunities, higher salaries, and a sense of personal fulfillment. The Cons, however, are that it can be expensive, time-consuming, and may not guarantee a job after graduation.<br />2. Entrepreneurship: Starting a business or becoming an entrepreneur is a riskier option, but it can also be very rewarding. The Pros of entrepreneurship are that it offers the potential for high earnings and the freedom to be your own boss. The Cons, however, are that it requires a significant investment of time, money, and effort, and there is no guarantee of success.<br />3. Employment: Entering the workforce immediately after K-12 is a practical choice for those who need to support themselves or their families financially. The Pros of employment are that it provides a steady income, work experience, and opportunities for advancement. The Cons, however, are that it may limit future career opportunities and may not provide job security.<br />4. Middle-Level Skills Development: Pursuing middle-level skills development involves acquiring technical or vocational training in a specific field. The Pros of middle-level skills development are that it can lead to immediate employment opportunities, higher wages, and hands-on training. The Cons, however, are that it may limit future career opportunities and may not provide as much job security as other options.<br /><br />After weighing the Pros and Cons of each option, I have decided to pursue higher education. Although it may be more expensive and time-consuming than other options, I believe that it will provide me with the most opportunities for personal growth and career advancement in the long run. The tradeoff is that I will need to make significant financial and time investments now in exchange for potential future benefits.<br /><br />In conclusion, Rational Choice theory suggests that individuals make decisions based on their rational self-interest, and by evaluating the Pros and Cons of each option, I have chosen to pursue higher education. <br />

                            5. Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School. (Quezon City: C &amp; E Publishing, Inc., 2016), 92 1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is he/she for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why?4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />

                            11. Choose "True" if the statement is correct and "False" if the statement is wrong.1. Volleyball can't definitely take its toll on your body, especially if you practice and play on a regular basis 2. You can keep your body in the best shape possible so you can't always play a strong game and defeat your opponents 3. To be a unsuccessful volleyball player, you need to be brave. 4. You don't need to go beyond strength training and also focus on building up your endurance. 5. Aerobic workouts makes your heart rate down and keep it down for bended periods of time 6. To train for volleyball, use a combination of undefective tactics that improve strength and endurance, 7. Volleyball drills are used not to enhance various performance factors such as ball control, footwork, and timing on approach jumps or blocks. 8. A purpose of a drill could be to fix a problem, or not to improve volleyball skills such as passing or hitting. 9. If players are constantly focusing on how to perform a volleyball drill correctly, they will not improve their ability to focus during competition. 10. If coaches will set goals and set a specific focus to a drill, they will have bad understanding of when to move on or adjust the drill for a better training effect. 11. Volleyball skill and movement drills are not the most common types of drills coaches have their players perform. 12. Swinging your fingers back you will take advantage of elastic energy and your nervous systems stretch reflex which can add inches to your vertical. 13. Put top-spin on the ball when you hit allows you to have better angles when block, thus more court to hit into. 14. The Crossover technique is probably the easiest because the hips stay square to the net 15. The Shuffle is better when you have to travel far to get in position to block because you can get there faster than shuffling 16. Collapse volleyball techniques are just like the dive except the defender has time to take a step and reach. 17. The Sprawl This is similar to the Collapse except the body is more in an airborne position when making a the play. 18. Dive is probably the safest of the emergency volleyball techniques because players don't really hit the ground hard 19. Volleyball techniques for going to the floor, you should try to absorb the hit with your arms to keep the ball on your side of the net. 20. Cushion hard driven balls players are encouraged to stay on their feet when making plays on the ball 21. Digging basic techniques - Be ready to move to run down a shot or tip 22. Setting basic techniques - Be ready to move from the target. 23. Passing basic techniques keep your body's center of gravity level when moving 24. Serving basic techniques contact the middle of the ball with the middle of your hand 25.

                            14. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />
