                                            Question: The author seems to have a critical view about teaching these days. He claims that kids "want to learn, but our current teaching models simply bore them to sleep (Par. 4). Is there truth in this? What aspect of current teaching bores you?
(4 paragraph)
It is precisely these unique qualities of the Generation that portend a
new, invigorated attitude toward education. They want to learn, but our current teaching models simply bore them to sleep. Education should excite and stimulate them. This is a generation that learns differently. They are ready and willing to be the future, but we have to engage them in ways that we have never imagined could be part of school.</a>

                                            Experiences of Cyber bullying 
The teachers were not aware of the extent of cyber bullying 
Another common theme was that the teachers did not seem to know the 
extent of cyber bullying. The students did not think that the teachers had enough 
knowledge about the issue and that they are from a generation that has not 
experienced this kind of dilemmas and situations that internet can cause. The 
students argued that the teachers need education in the subject of cyber bullying in 
order to get an understanding about it. 
“The teachers are from another generation; they do not know how affected 
the victim becomes.” (Student C1)
“The teachers should be educated about cyber bullying in order to tackle it.” 
(Student A4)
“There is a new generation that are growing up in this technological 
environment, teachers need to learn and be educated in order to understand this 
generation. Cyber bullying is something new teachers and other adults needs to get 
information about.” (Student C4)
“Teachers do not understand much about cyber bullying and how much 
harm it can cause, they should be educated.” (Student C2) 
Based on the comments from the interviewed students, this issue of teachers 
being unaware of the extent of cyber bullying among students, could be connected 
to age. According to Berger and Luckmann (1966 in Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2009) 
experiences and knowledge are stored in memory of individuals and between 
individuals. The teachers who are grown up in a time where technologies were not 
as developed as today might have difficulties with relating to this issue of cyber 
7 bullying because they have no memories or experiences of cyber bullying and 
therefore they cannot understand it fully. Reality is constructed differently due to 
age. (Kakai, 2016)

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is firstly identified in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 as a pneumonia of unknown origin (1). Later, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) identifies the causative agent of COVID-19 as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus−2 (SARS–CoV−2) (2). COVID-19 outbreak spreads rapidly not only in China, but also worldwide, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced it as pandemic on March 12, 2020 (3). The total number of confirmed cases and mortalities are 23,491,520 and 809,970, respectively, in 216 countries as of August 25, 2020 (4).</p><p></p><p>Several governmental measures have been taken to counteract the risk of disease spreading. These measures include travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines for travelers, social distancing, bans on public gatherings, schools and universities closure, business closures, self-isolation, asking people to work at home, curfews, and lockdown (5, 6). Authorities in several countries worldwide have declared either lockdown or curfew as a measure to break the fast spread of virus infection (7). These measures have a negative worldwide effect on the business, education, health, and tourism (8).</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 pandemic has affected all levels of the education system (9). Educational institutions around the world (in 192 countries) have either temporarily closed or implemented localized closures affecting about 1.7 billion of student population worldwide (10). Many universities around the world either postponed or canceled all campus activities to minimize gatherings and hence decrease the transmission of virus. However, these measures lead to higher economical, medical, and social implications on both undergraduate and postgraduate communities (9, 11).</p><p></p><p>Due to the suspension of classroom teaching in many colleges and universities, a switch to the online teaching for undergraduate and graduate students becomes effective [reviewed in (12, 13)]. This form of learning provides an alternative way to minimize either the contact between students themselves or between the students and lecturers (8). However, many students have no access to the online teaching due to lack of either the means or the instruments due to economical and digital divide (14).</p><p></p><p>Few studies highlighted COVID-19 in relation to educational studies. COVID-19 has a profound impact on medical students, dental medical students, and radiology trainee (15–20). Recently, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) showed that COVID-19 adversely impacted veterinary practices based on a large survey inculing about 2,000 responses (21). However, there is no studies investigated the effect of COVID-19 on students in veterinary medical field. Therefore, the current study was conducted to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the academic performance of veterinary medical students and researchers during the lockdown.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><br />

</p><p>Table 3 presents the attitude of the students towards speaking in English.
</p><p>As gleaned from the table, statements 11 and 17 received the highest mean.
</p><p>Students believe that speaking English is important because they might need it 
</p><p>later for their job as suggested in statement number 11. In general, speaking in 
</p><p>English is important to the students. 
</p><p>More so, they think that if they put much effort in practicing, they can 
</p><p>speak English well. However, findings also indicate that the students are worried 
</p><p>about making mistakes when speaking in English. Along this line, Batang and 
</p><p>Temporal (2018) opined that the negative attitude of students could be ascribed to 
</p><p>their inhibitions in using the English language especially when they are with 
</p><p>people who speak English well. They would rather not speak than commit
</p><p>mistakes and be laughed at by their interlocutors. Students’ feeling of intimidation 
</p><p>could also be spelled from the worries and discomfort they experience both in and 
</p><p>out of the classroom.
</p><p>Many other studies have been conducted to explore the nature of students’ 
</p><p>attitudes towards learning foreign language in general and EFL in particular, 
</p><p>compared with the studies concerning the attitudes towards speaking in English. 
</p><p>For instance, Shams (2008) conducted a study attempting to investigate 
</p><p>students’ attitudes, motivation and anxiety towards the learning of English. The 
</p><p>findings underlined that the students had affirmative attitudes and high 
</p><p>enthusiasm towards English. This also highlighted that most of them showed 
</p><p>positive attitudes towards English language and its learning which, in turn, 
</p><p>emphasized the value of English language efficiency in the daily life.
</p><p>The findings of study by Al-Tamimi and Shuib (2009) on Petroleum 
</p><p>Engineering students’ motivation and attitudes towards learning English revealed 
</p><p>that they had positive attitudes towards the use of English in the Yemeni social 
</p><p>and educational contexts. They also showed affirmative attitude towards the 
</p><p>culture of the English-speaking world.
</p><p>Generally, Grade 12 Academic Track SHS students have positive attitude 
</p><p>towards speaking in English as Speaking in English is important to them. These 
</p><p>students are on their last year in the Senior High School and are candidates either

It is precisely these unique qualities of the Generation that portend a
new, invigorated attitude toward education. They want to learn, but our current teaching models simply bore them to sleep. Education should excite and stimulate them.

                        <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong></p><p>An educated Filipino knows how to respect everybody, be it an old person or a young person. In our current era, we Filipinos need to have self-control and responsible behavior. Even if things don't go their way, we stay patient and solve the issue in a proper manner. With appropriate and consistent discipline, we learn about consequences and taking responsibility for our own actions. Our culture and its potential is of great value to every one of us, because not only does it gives us a great perspective but it also reflects on how we can be a role model to others especially the youth itself. The ultimate aim is to encourage the Filipino youth to learn to manage both their feelings and behavior. Discipline allows us Filipinos to develop self-discipline, and helps them become emotionally and socially mature adults.     </p><p></p><br />

                            28. Experiences of Cyber bullying 
The teachers were not aware of the extent of cyber bullying 
Another common theme was that the teachers did not seem to know the 
extent of cyber bullying. The students did not think that the teachers had enough 
knowledge about the issue and that they are from a generation that has not 
experienced this kind of dilemmas and situations that internet can cause. The 
students argued that the teachers need education in the subject of cyber bullying in 
order to get an understanding about it. 
“The teachers are from another generation; they do not know how affected 
the victim becomes.” (Student C1)
“The teachers should be educated about cyber bullying in order to tackle it.” 
(Student A4)
“There is a new generation that are growing up in this technological 
environment, teachers need to learn and be educated in order to understand this 
generation. Cyber bullying is something new teachers and other adults needs to get 
information about.” (Student C4)
“Teachers do not understand much about cyber bullying and how much 
harm it can cause, they should be educated.” (Student C2) 
Based on the comments from the interviewed students, this issue of teachers 
being unaware of the extent of cyber bullying among students, could be connected 
to age. According to Berger and Luckmann (1966 in Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2009) 
experiences and knowledge are stored in memory of individuals and between 
individuals. The teachers who are grown up in a time where technologies were not 
as developed as today might have difficulties with relating to this issue of cyber 
7 bullying because they have no memories or experiences of cyber bullying and 
therefore they cannot understand it fully. Reality is constructed differently due to 
age. (Kakai, 2016)

                        CYBER BULLYING<p>Every human being are now using social media and for some it became their life. However, there are thin line between the students and the teachers in terms of perspectives in social media. This result to misunderstanding between the two generation.  And through the immensely usage of social media problems like cyber bullying occurs. <strong>Cyber bullying </strong>is another kind of bullying that occurs only inside the internet and one of the most used platform is social media. It might be in the form of negative comments or any harsh statements from people inside social media. <strong>Cyber bullying</strong> is immensely evident in our society, it can happen in just one click of your finger tip. Moreover, that is where the problem occurs since teachers especially those elderly do not spend more time in social media, they are not that exposed in the massive effect and aftermath that <strong>cyber bullying</strong> give.</p><p>However, this misunderstanding between the students and teachers discussing<strong> cyber bullying</strong> can be fix if they expands their understanding and have more sympathy for the victims who suffer from <strong>cyber bullying</strong>. </p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying: brainly.ph/question/2250326</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
