"Beauty and the Beast" is considered as one of the most iconic
Walt Disney films ever produced both in animation and live action.
The story is all about a beautiful and simple but smart village girl
named Belle who was imprisoned in the horrific castle
of the Beast.
Belle was never considered as a prisoner and was treated well as a
guest. Eventually she and the Beast became friends. Beast was happy
about this because no one had ever appreciated him except his
servants. Along with the Beast's happiness, the servants were as well
overjoyed because Belle might be "the one" who could end the curse.
Now, if you were part of this story, why do you think Belle felt comfortable with the Beast despite his hideous looks?

"Beauty and the Beast" is considered as one of the most iconic
Walt Disney films ever produced both in animation and live action.

named Belle who was imprisoned in the horrific castle
of the Beast.
Belle was never considered as a prisoner and was treated well as a
guest. Eventually she and the Beast became friends. Beast was happy
about this because no one had ever appreciated him except his
servants. Along with the Beast's happiness, the servants were as well
overjoyed because Belle might be "the one" who could end the curse.
Now, if you were part of this story, why do you think Belle felt comfortable with the Beast despite his hideous looks?
