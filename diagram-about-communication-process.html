Encoding is the process of converting the sender's thoughts and ideas into a message that can be easily understood by the receiver. The message is then transmitted through a channel, which can be verbal, nonverbal, or written. The receiver decodes the message, which is the process of interpreting the message and assigning meaning to it. The final step is feedback, where the receiver sends a message back to the sender to indicate whether they understood the message or not. This diagram represents the basic communication process.</p><br />
