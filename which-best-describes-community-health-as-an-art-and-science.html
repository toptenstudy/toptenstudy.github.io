Communication is defined as the process of understanding and sharing meaning (Pearson &amp; Nelson, 2000).</p><p></p><p>At the center of our study of communication is the relationship that involves interaction between participants. This definition serves us well with its emphasis on the process, which we’ll examine in depth across this text, of coming to understand and share another’s point of view effectively.</p><p></p><p>The first key word in this definition is process. A process is a dynamic activity that is hard to describe because it changes (Pearson &amp; Nelson, 2000). Imagine you are alone in your kitchen thinking. Someone you know (say, your mother) enters the kitchen and you talk briefly.</p><br />
