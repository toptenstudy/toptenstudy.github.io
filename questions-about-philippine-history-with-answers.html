                                            What's InDirections: Read the following text. Answer what is being askedThe Philippines is visited by an average of 19 typhoons annually. With thesetyphoons come other disasters, one of which is storm surge. A storm surge is anabnormal rise of water primarily caused by the strong winds of a typhoon. It is producedwhen the wind circulation near the eye of the typhoon blows on the surface of the seaor ocean. This produces a vertical circulation in the ocean which is disrupted by theocean floor once it reaches the sha low coastal area. Since the water cannot go downanymore, there is no other way but to go inland. A storm surge is further aggravatedduring high tides. For instance, a 20-feet storm surge on top of a 3-feet high tide wiltproduce a 3-feet storm surge. The highest recorded storm surge in history is 43 feet atBathurst Bay.Source: Academic Reading and Writing for Senior High SchoolGuide Questions:1. What is the text all about?2.

I also believe that they are essential because nowadays, a lot of people are not that interested as before in local products and most especially the arts because they usually like foreign products. With these agencies, they keep Philippine art alive. Because of them, we learn to appreciate and love our own. And eventually, and hopefully in the future, we Filipinos will be able to promote and be proud of our own art, history, and culture" (Writes, 2017). ) 1) If you were given an opportunity to create an agency that would promote and preserve arts from the regions of the Philippines, what will be the name of the agency? 2) What will be the three main goals or focuses of the agency? 3) As a student, how will you promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts? State three actions that you will do to promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts.​</a>

With thesetyphoons come other disasters, one of which is storm surge. A storm surge is anabnormal rise of water primarily caused by the strong winds of a typhoon. It is producedwhen the wind circulation near the eye of the typhoon blows on the surface of the seaor ocean. This produces a vertical circulation in the ocean which is disrupted by theocean floor once it reaches the sha low coastal area. Since the water cannot go downanymore, there is no other way but to go inland. A storm surge is further aggravatedduring high tides. For instance, a 20-feet storm surge on top of a 3-feet high tide wiltproduce a 3-feet storm surge. The highest recorded storm surge in history is 43 feet atBathurst Bay.Source: Academic Reading and Writing for Senior High SchoolGuide Questions:1. What is the text all about?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the video, the Cavite Mutiny was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the secret society called the Katipunan. The reason behind the mutiny was their desire to seek independence from Spanish colonial rule and to establish a Philippine republic.</p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>The 1872 Cavite event can be seen as both a local mutiny and a national revolution. On the one hand, it was a local mutiny in the sense that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was limited to the Cavite region. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a national revolution in the sense that it was part of a wider movement for independence that was taking place throughout the Philippines at the time.</p><p></p><p>The Cavite Mutiny is an important event in the history of the Philippines because it marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution, which eventually led to the country's independence from Spanish colonial rule. It is also significant because it brought to light the issues of colonial oppression, exploitation, and injustice that were prevalent in the Philippines at the time, and helped to galvanize the movement for independence.</p><p></p><p>Based on the sources introduced, my understanding of the past has been enhanced by learning about the different perspectives and interpretations of the Cavite Mutiny. The sources have provided valuable insights into the motivations and goals of the revolutionaries, as well as the context in which the mutiny took place. They have also helped to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of the Philippine Revolution, and the many different factors that contributed to it.</p><p></p><p>For the table:</p><p></p><p>CONTENT: The main idea of the Cavite Mutiny is that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the Katipunan.</p><p></p><p>CONTEXT: The Cavite Mutiny took place in the Cavite region of the Philippines in 1872, at a time when the country was still under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>COMMUNICATION: The source is reliable because it is based on historical records and accounts of the event.</p><p></p><p>CREATOR: The source was created by historians who have studied the Cavite Mutiny and the Philippine Revolution.</p><p></p><p>CONNECTION: Prior to reading this source, my knowledge of the Cavite Mutiny was limited to a general understanding of its significance in the history of the Philippines.

It has also helped me to better understand the issues of colonial oppression, exploitation, and injustice that were prevalent in the Philippines at the time, and the role that the Cavite Mutiny played in the movement for independence.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Rodrigo Duterte is the Best President in the World. No one can beat his record as the best and strongest President in the world of all time. His genuine leadership is most admired and loved of the majority Filipino people specially the masses. On April 20, 2017, he ranked as the most influential leader in the world according to the online worldwide survey of Time Magazine. It is because of his effective and genuine leadership specially how he implemented effectively on War on Drugs, Fighting Corruptions and Poverty, implementing big projects such as boosting our infrastructure under the Build! Build! Build! Project called the “GOLDEN ERA OF THE PHILIPPINE INFRASTRUCTURE” and many more! In just a year, there are more achievements under his leadership even if you combine the three decades of the past presidents in from Corazon Aquizon to her son Benigno Aquino. He is unmatched in his achievements in the recorded history of the Republic of the Philippines.QUESTIONS 1 What does the author say about President Duterte? 2 Is the author for or against President Duterte? Why do you say so? 3. Is the author biased in what s/he said / wrote? If yes, give at least three examples of biased statements. (If your answer no, go to Question #5.)4. Why do your say these statements are biased? (If you answered this, no need to answer Questions #5). 5. If you answered NO in number 3, why do you say that the author is not biased? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Author says that the current president of the Republic of the Philippines is the best and gives several reasons why.</p><p>2. The author is in favor of the current president as the text was heavily in favor of the president.</p><p>3 and 4. The author is biased. First of all, the second and third sentences are an opinion, not a fact. The fourth sentence is false, there is no such thing as "Most Influential Leader" by Time Magazine. There is no proof of the effectiveness of War on Drugs, corruption is still heavily prevalent, and we arent in the Golden Era of the Philippine Infrastructure because of the Build Build Build Project - We arent even in a Golden Era. Lastly, the last two sentences are obviously opinions, and in fact are false - you can research about this easily with credible sources.</p><p></p><br />

Afterwards, answer and do the following indicated questions and task. Write your answer on your answer sheet. "I believe that each agency has its own job that will help in keeping Philippine known to a lot of people not just here in the Philippines. I also believe that they are essential because nowadays, a lot of people are not that interested as before in local products and most especially the arts because they usually like foreign products. With these agencies, they keep Philippine art alive. Because of them, we learn to appreciate and love our own. And eventually, and hopefully in the future, we Filipinos will be able to promote and be proud of our own art, history, and culture" (Writes, 2017). ) 1) If you were given an opportunity to create an agency that would promote and preserve arts from the regions of the Philippines, what will be the name of the agency? 2) What will be the three main goals or focuses of the agency? 3) As a student, how will you promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1The culture of the Philippines, an island country in the South-East Asia, represents a huge range of very outstanding and fascinating traditions. Nevertheless, for anyone who would like to discuss the issue of the Filipino contemporary theatre, the difficult and very complicated postcolonial history of the country appears as one of the main challenges. The Philippines were first colonized by Spain (1565-1898) and later (in the 20th century) by the USA. People in the Philippines used to say that they had spent 350 years in the convent and 50 years in Hollywood. But as long as we can speak about a strong influence, which both of those countries had on the Filipino nation and culture, we cannot forget that we can never speak about the entire removal of local traditions and aesthetics.</p><p></p><p>aw8 sa 50pts mo te</p><br />
